Ted Cruz Prosecutes and Marco Rubio Gets Personal at Town Hall http://bit.ly/1QKBE4r 
@nikkihaley  Governor, I am surprised & disappointed that you decided to endorse Rubio over Cruz. Cruz is far & away the greater intellect.
Notice that Greta Van Susteren continually interrupted the Cruz spokesman but said nothing while Trumps cronie spewed her venom & lies !!

On #MTP @SenTedCruz says @POTUS shouldn't "upset balance of SCOTUS." If lib justice dies, will Pres Cruz promise to keep balance? #nonsense
So far in South Carolina I have seen one huge Cruz sign, and one small Carson sign #anecdata
All of the established republicans are shaking in their boots !  Ted Cruz is in 3rd place & moving into 2nd ! This is Conservatives Man !
I want the debates to get down to Trump, Cruz, Rubio & Christie ! Otherwise we will not hear what we want the candidates to declare !
For me, Bush; Kasich, Carson are out ! Then, ranking the ones remaining are Cruz, Trump, Christie, Rubio in that order of choice !!
Drm Ben Carson shows us that although he professes Christianity,  he has no Grace ! He will not forgive Cruz for his staffs mistake !!
@rickwtyler @KatyinIndy  Rubio is a dud ! Support Cruz and America with a vote for him.

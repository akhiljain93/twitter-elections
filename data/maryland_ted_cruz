Paul Manafort tells reporters tonight, "Some states are more important for them. If he (Cruz) doesn’t win Indiana, he should quit."
Funny, I don't remember the media getting this excited about Cruz winning his home state of Texas or Kasich winning his home state of Ohio.
Kasich to come in second in NY, per NBC News. Bodes badly for Cruz as race turns to states better suited for him.

So Cruz, the man the GOP is allegedly uniting around, may come out of NY with 0 delegates.
Very unusual speech from Cruz here in Philly tonight. More upliftment and empowerment than his usual notes of anger and frustration.

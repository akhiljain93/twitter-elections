Donald Trump: "Senator Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated”  http://cnn.it/NYPrimary  #NYPrimaryhttp://cnn.it/1VANMge 
In Bronx's #NY15, Trump received 604 votes and won three delegates. In North Country's #NY21, Kasich received 17,868 votes and won ZERO.
This is hilarious. Trump may win every single NY county except… wait for it…  Manhattan.
82% of Staten Island voted for Trump. Remaining 18% found dead.
Trump called 9/11 7/11 and he still won NY

This would make NY the first state where Trump won a majority, and make him the first GOPer to win a majority in his home state.
Early exits show Trump poised for huge delegate sweep. He's at 58%--above 50% in all regions except the 'rural upstate.'

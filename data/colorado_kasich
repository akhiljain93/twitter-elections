@greggutfeld @JoeC1776 Kasich had his best moment bashing Obama's failed leadership with FBI and Apple. But just lock Obama in a room alone.
Cruz for Supreme Court! Or Atty Gen Carson for Surgeon Gen or HHS Rubio for Homeland Security Kasich for VA reform Huckabee for Flat Tax ref
So stop already with Trump ego..Carson & Kasich won't drop out and Cruz & Rubio won't step aside and most have said no to VP b/c they want P
@PeakLeftism ...is it 1 on 1 where Rubio won 4 states on Super Tuesday and Cruz/Kasich bowed to rally-round-Rubio pressure?
@PeakLeftism Depends. Is it 1 on 1 where Trump swept all 13 Super Tuesday states & Cruz/Kasich dropped out in hopeless despair, or...
If you told Rubio last summer he'd be in a 3-way fight in February vs. Trump & Cruz (plus Kasich & Carson in single digits) he'd be ECSTATIC
IF Trump is changing the election then Carson and Kasich should follow Jeb's! lead and get out now as well.  3 man race.

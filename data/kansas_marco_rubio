@BlueWaterDays Minnesota is also the only state that Ronald Reagan lost in his landslide 1984 election.#so much for Rubio's big win!!
@megynkelly  Megyn, Big deal Rubio won the only state that Reagan lost in 1984.#so much for Rubio's claim that he the next Ronald Reagan!
@realDonaldTrump is saying "Rubio is nasty and the worst liar". You don't have policies + you're not even original with insults? #HairForce1
How is @tedcruz the only one who can beat Donald when he consistently finishes third behind Rubio? Your Iowa finish doesn't mean a thing

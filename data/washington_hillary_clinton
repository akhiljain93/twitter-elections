@iwelsh I empathize, but please don't. I knew Clinton was a crook and the system was rigged before this even started. #NeverTrump

Oh joy. Hillary is speaking in Seattle. Watching TV at home. Smarm is dripping from the screen. Totally different from Bernie's sober tone.

@alexis_levinson @TimAlberta establishment spent tens of millions attacking him. Hillary is thrilled he is out.
Clinton vs. Trump, I am leaning to the former 55% to 45% only cus I supported her in 2008.It could change in Nov. #CNNElection
When are government supports for people who were in long term relationships when tinder was invented going to start rolling out? #Hillary?
Hillary is going hard in the paint on twitter today!!!

Polls could be off if Hillary is alienating large numbers of voters very quickly, or if land-line bias is excluding many young Bernie voters
Last I heard, Hillary was still leading in all of tomorrow's states. Let's see if Michigan was unique or if polls are systematically off.
That Clinton statement on the Trump protests barely makes sense as a rational argument... On top of being a very bad done regardless. :/
@hoosierworld Rubio actually pointed out on TV that there is no violence at his rallies, or Cruz's, or Hillary's. Only Trump's.
@hoosierworld Right-wing discussion and protest can be had at any other Republican's rallies, or at Hillary's, w/o any present violence.
Hillary Clinton's Reagan gaffe did indeed astonish me—but only because of its ineptitude, not because of its level of dishonesty.
Hillary's campaign is so inept I'm surprised there's not a conspiracy theory that she's trying to take a fall so Rubio or Kasich can win.

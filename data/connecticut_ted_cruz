Clearly New Yorkers do not appreciate Cruz values
Them Woodstock kids are hilarious 
What do you do with Mighty Mouse now? He's laid waste to the division. Pay the man some $ & let him fight the Cruz-Faber winner for 135 belt
Presidential race is between circus clown, FBI suspect, communist and honest, respected leader. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU7LmmyQHRc … #NYPrimary #CT4Cruz

Cruz only makes me sad, outraged, scared
@JayS2629 Cruz's campaign chart clearly peaked on Apr 12th, the day of the Colo del steal. It has been trending sharply down since that day.

Is Ted Cruz a likable guy? I've been with Ted since New Hampshire. He's  a real "mensch" - a family man! http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Ted-Cruz-likable-guy-He-s-working-on-that-7295801.php … #CTPrimary

@BreitbartNews If that is the case; That's the end of Cruz
@CNN Cruz is so jealous he can't count! Back to old tricks, bribery, favors, gratuities to buy delegates where he can! OK w GOPe?
@magnifier661 @amandacarpenter @CNN Lol, nothing she says means anything, she's a Cruz flunky.  http://q13fox.com/2016/04/19/ap-ted-cruz-now-mathematically-eliminated-from-clinching-gop-nomination-before-convention/ …
@ChrisLoesch @toddstarnes Cruz gets 0 NY delegates and couldn't crack 50% in TX - he's officially finished.
With Cruz pretty much mathematically eliminated tonight, you have to assume we're all but locked-in to Clinton v Trump.
Tonight is a massive win for @realDonaldTrump in every way. He wins big while Cruz collapses. His campaign's evolving by the day. #NYPrimary

@GiantsPrincess1 @thehill I sure do NOT want to see that! Gross! Just the sight of Cruz makes my skin crawl. More like a tool for torture!

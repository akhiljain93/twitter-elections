After this RI event I can see why Kasich did so well in New Hampshire. Very folksy, very comfortable in the town hall format, and he's funny

@bpolitics @slone didn't he say Kasich should get out of race when he was mathematically elimated? Hope Lyin'Ted takes his own advice!
Keeping an eye on NY county results. Cruz and Kasich may pick up some delegates chipping away at The Douche's total.
If John Kasich beats Trump in MANHATTAN - home to Trump Tower thus those who know Trump best - that's a YUGE #CruzCrew (talking point) win!
Does anyone else find it funny that John Kasich is winning Manhattan? #NYPrimary
@werthe3percent @handley_dix @Nelsonian210 Cruz, Kasich and Rubio all failed to crack 50% in their homestates.

@clantro @JuliannAndreen @DancrDave Kasich's role is no secret. He's doing the best for our party, nation, planet. He's sacrificing for us.
It's getting tense! RT @thehill: WATCH: Kasich grabs reporter’s mic during heated exchange http://hill.cm/ptaKIhu pic.twitter.com/j0u1SAZlY3
@clantro @JuliannAndreen @DancrDave I agree. His role is to force a brokered convention.  Kasich knows exactly what he's doing.

@Fixer_guy @70torinoman @latimes I swear if she's nominee she'll pick Kasich as VP. Sell it as necessary to defeat Trump.
Thinking way off the political reality, how about crossing lines and pairing Hilary with Kasich as VP to battle any Trump or Cruz threat

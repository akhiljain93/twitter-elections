@CNBC Trump brought his secret mistress on vacation with his family.  Can he be trusted in office?
@CNBC Trump's answers reveal a lack of experience in elected office.
@MedvedSHOW @realDonaldTrump Michael Medved is such a GOP stooge. Open your eyes. The voters love Donald Trump. #Buckeyes for Trump
Trump ads running here in Ohio are so evil…but effective - Kasich is going down
On the other hand, quotes from Trump himself show that statements he make re: his finances are at least partially subjective.
It's funny, you CONSTANTLY see people parroting the "Trump has far more successful businesses than failed ones" line, but no one backs it up
@Drasinius @Fyrasec Well he's at least trying to bring about a better situation. Hillary and Trump are motivated solely by ego.

Marco Hernandez (3-for-4) drills a clutch, 2-out, 2-strike RBI double to tie the game at 3-3 in the 7th. #PawSox still batting, 2 on & 2 out
@AppSame @JohnKasich Kasich needs to quit after Tuesday. Rubio still has more delegates than he does and dropped out mid March!
I just got a random text saying "Marco" so naturally I asked Tj if I should respond with "Polo".......he didn't think it was funny
Marco!  Polo! Claire!  Suzette! Murtagh! ARE YOU THERE GOD? ITS ME JAMIE FRASER!!! #JamieIsSolo #Outlander

Marco has polio? I don't want to play that game in the water.
Deven Marrero with a 2-out single, steals 2nd, and scores go-ahead run on a double by Marco Hernandez. #PawSox take 6-5 lead over LVY B7th

@KasichPresident @marcorubio @HillaryClinton @JohnKasich THAT I'd like 2 see! Kasich/Rubio only 2 w/viable plans & demeanor 2 represent USA
@rose10052 Kasich is here Saturday. Most of the Rubio team here joined Kasich. My guess is Kasich will be second. Big tRUMP win. Dumb voters
@rescuetracker81 cruz should take his advise to kasich & Rubio and drop out
KP crushes Walpole 5-0!!! Congrats to Nick, Marco and Ronit on their first varsity wins. #RollWarriors #Happy4/20pic.twitter.com/xLkDxfRPTz
Red Sox announce roster moves that include #PawSox pitchers William Cuevas & Noe Ramirez going to Boston & INF Marco Hernandez to Pawtucket
Red Sox moves: - Joe Kelly 15-day DL - RHP's Noe Ramirez, William Cuevas recalled - Marco Hernandez optioned - Edwin Escobar (AAA) DFA'd
Except for small recoveries, Cruz's campaign is on a terminal slide down. It will join Jeb, Marco and the others next month. @OnlyHotyP
Yo my cat literally doesn't understand how taking a dump works. It gets sketched out and just dips out the moment it starts dookin

@werthe3percent @handley_dix @Nelsonian210 Cruz, Kasich and Rubio all failed to crack 50% in their homestates.
We are thrilled to welcome @WhiteHouse veteran, Marco Davis, to our team! Read more here: http://bit.ly/1NzUT01 pic.twitter.com/TSlr65P52t
@charlescwcooke @TheFix we blew sure win when we blew off Rubio however I do think Cruz could come close. Trump is a lost cause.
@obrien9696 @BoilerSandy @brechtgirl Rubio supporters never deny that he supported amnesty-they just attack the person making the accusation
@mitchellvii More advice from the Estb who implanted the image of Rubio sizing up a guy's manhood whenever he shakes their hands..Brilliant!

@PrayForMarco @BamaStephen I was thinking last night about Marco's suspending & see God has been protecting him/family from all this hate.

@jamespavlick @WendyRedFox @rose10052 Really? He LIED and misrepresented Marco Rubio's positions over and over. He can go to hell!
@JohnKasich @PorcupinePundit Some guy named Marco Rubio also beat HRC in almost every poll. Still has more delegates than Kasich.
@brechtgirl @rose10052 Marco should have supported Cruz from the beginning - the nomination would be over by now if he had
@brechtgirl @rose10052 Good grief!  What "lies" did Cruz tell about Marco.  Cruz has never lied about anything - ever.
@Dictionarycom @BernieSanders has the brightest vocabulary of all these candidates! Cruz and Rubio have a low vocabulary, rest is moderate
@rose10052 If you want to stop Trump, absolutely, please please consider voting for Marco as a write-in.  You say he's the best, right?
@E__Strobel GOP understand science? Which ones? Trump? Cruz? Rubio? Lol. What a sad joke

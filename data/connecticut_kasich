@mmurraypolitics @Bencjacobs Imagine voters who still think Cruz or Kasich has a chance. So misinformed.

@bpolitics @slone didn't he say Kasich should get out of race when he was mathematically elimated? Hope Lyin'Ted takes his own advice!
@werthe3percent @handley_dix @Nelsonian210 Cruz, Kasich and Rubio all failed to crack 50% in their homestates.
@vivelafra Great job, NY! Keep it going thru MD, PA, DE, CT, RI! Let's all get 50+% 4 Trump to sweep LyinTed & Nowhere Kasich out!
Geez... Kasich is a grumpy old man! Did anyone else hear that on fix? I mean fox....

Trump was just here. Clinton is coming, Kasich is coming back, and now Bernie may be here too. Here's the latest. http://bit.ly/Connecticut-Vote-2016?cid=twitter_WTNH …
Of the people I spoke to in New Ro, Bernie is winning. Close between him and Hilary. One person for each trump and Kasich. No one for Cruz
@clantro @JuliannAndreen @DancrDave Kasich's role is no secret. He's doing the best for our party, nation, planet. He's sacrificing for us.
@clantro @JuliannAndreen @DancrDave I agree. His role is to force a brokered convention.  Kasich knows exactly what he's doing.
If you're a Republican and you're not voting for Kasich, then I don't know why you're voting at all
@Always_Trump  Come on MD! Let's get 50+%. 4 Trump! Lyin Ted is bought & paid 4, Nowhere Kasich supports TPP & NAFTA! No jobs!

@politico @JohnKasich What's next?  Will George Washington's second cousin ten times removed endorse Kasich?
@rose10052 And any delegates Kasich gets will support Trump. Just look at Michigan.They have a deal-if you like Trump just be open about it.
@rose10052 @ShawnMcElhinney Besides, Kasich is an annoying little crapweasel who supports gun control and expanded Obamacare.
@rose10052 @ShawnMcElhinney For the love of God, a vote for Kasich only enables Trump.  Look at Michigan. A vote for Kasich is a vote 4Trump

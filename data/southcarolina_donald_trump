Be afraid America.  If Cruz takes both South Carolina & Nevada;  Trump will go 3rd party ! He will not be able to deal with losing.

As I've said for months now;  Trump is going to be a 3rd party candidate. Exactly what Perot did.  Making certain of a Democrat victory !!

Trump complements Alabama football team AGAIN to boos in front of South Carolina crowd. #sec
Trump points to the crowd "still pouring in" during rally. Audience heads turn. No one is pouring in.
It took Trump 20 minutes to mention another candidate....and it's a glancing mention to Jeb Bush. Much different from earlier in the week.
Trump: "....and then the president goes to a mosque and he apologizes. What's going on?"
Trump to Florence crowd: "You have the most beautiful churches I've seen....I almost wanted to go in and just pray."

ICYMI #Wisconsin, Warren endorses Sanders! #Msm missed last line if they think she's going to be HRCs running mate. http://www.discussionist.com/1015788569 
Someone please reassure me that I’m making a good decision to go to the Bernie rally instead of study for my exam. YOLO right???
Party politics.... Sanders has the better ground game for sure. http://fb.me/4yhw9NBbk

It's gonna be cold tomorrow, but that won't stop us in Wisconsin!  See you at the March for Bernie tomorrow  at 11:00 AM. @WaupacaBernieSC
Sanders at +4 in the new Marquette poll, plus the open primary format which has favored him thus far. It looks very good.

@LisaBlackman7 @AG_Conservative Because Rubio is likely to receive more late-breaking voters, especially in GA and TN.
This weekend has had so much America in it. #ReaganBash #Rubio @ Samford University https://www.instagram.com/p/BCTnxNQqvhR/

@TeamMarco @marcorubio I've been supporting Marco since day 1, and tonight's debate performance is why. #GOPDebate
I decided I need to follow @AG_Conservative, because he is dispensing that sweet Rubio Kool-Aid. I need the reassurance.
@Anish_Dave @stephenfhayes He cannot. Too busy boasting about Rubio coming in 2nd place. Give Rubio a partcipation trophy.
@FoxNewsSunday Chris "congatrs Rubio on ur 2nd place finish". Really? Give Rub a participation trophy. You did not win, you lost.
@TeamMarco @marcorubio just gave a very Presidential sounding speech... Marco... Marco... Marco...!!! #marcorubioforpresident
@bobcesca_go Sigh… How can Chris Matthews say that Rubio isn’t “nuts in any way”?
C’mon Cruz, you’re not above slinging mud yourself. You’ve thrown it at Rubio plenty of times. Everyone does it.
Phenomenal job by @marcorubio at the #GOPTownHall. Good questions from Anderson Cooper that let Rubio act naturally.

A town hall is the perfect setting for Rubio to show his strengths. #CNNTownHall

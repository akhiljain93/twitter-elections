I don't agree with @ChrisLoesch via Cruz or Conservatism, but he couldn't be more accurate about a Clinton vs Trump contest

If Donald Trump wins the GOP nomination then Hillary might as well start writing her Inauguration address
Do Democratic caucuses/primaries even matter if super delegates are involved? Hillary can lose by 30 and still gain more sd's than Bernie
My ideal #WeekendAtBernies - I respect Hillary but I'm sold @ Amurica https://www.instagram.com/p/BB-VTXqCCIw/

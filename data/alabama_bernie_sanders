@vakaviti Yeah, hard to quantify. But Bernie Sanders is about as far left as you can get, and he has the youth vote.
If you think Cam Newton is a sore loser, you've obviously never seen a Bernie Sanders supporter!  #FeeltheBern
@RaiderUte If big government could consistently get results like that, I’d vote for Bernie Sanders.
@adammc123 I'd be more concerned if Bernie were the nominee tbh.
@Jon_D_ Not if Trump or Sanders have anything to say about it.
It's a perfect day for lunch at Bernie's on Main in Columbiana. Shelby County is getting on… https://www.instagram.com/p/BB8ByaBzNjp/ 
@jdbalart Please ask Bernie about Sierra Blanca and how he screwed Latinos. His own Flint! pic.twitter.com/RzHohXmk0w
What the hell are Hillary's Super PACs waiting for to out Bernie's lies???
Surprise, surprise, @Lawrence just reported Hillary and Bernie in a tie nationwide??? I wonder whose ass he pulled that poll from?

@tomwatson  Do you think there will ever be any serious vetting on Bernie by the media? Feels like we're doing it for them, but to no avail.
Sanders in 1985: Castro ‘Educated Their Kids, Gave Their Kids Health Care, Totally Transformed Society’ http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/zachary-leshin/sanders-1985-cuba-castro-educated-their-kids-gave-their-kids-health-care#.VsKrhjzLwto.twitter …  No words...
@tommyxtopher @iRhysTay @chrislhayes Now if he could only TRY to do some vetting on Bernie. But I can only dream...
@rosiebudpisces @princessomuch @docrocktex26  SuperPacs R wrkng 2 help him get elected, but Bernie fans are like.... pic.twitter.com/5dwI0Z5ips
@bizzle_scott @kellylmiller @joanwalsh GOP finds Bernie a lot easier 2beat. That's why they are helping his campaign. They want HIM. Duh!
@MSNBC FEC launches inquiry into hundreds of “excessive” contributions to Bernie Sanders campaign http://www.dailynewsbin.com/news/fec-launches-inquiry-into-hundreds-of-excessive-contributions-to-bernie-sanders-campaign/23817/ … via @dailynewsbin
Sanders supporters revolt against superdelegates http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-superdelegates-democrats-219286 …  So, tell me again who's trying to steal the election???
How about @MSNBC gives @HillaryClinton equal time with her soeeches? Tired of listening to Bernie fairy tales. pic.twitter.com/tJIkQiVRiC
Bernie Sanders is a Communist and an Ignoramus http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/259477/bernie-sanders-communist-and-ignoramus-matthew-vadum#.VsI39V_o2CQ.twitter … A MUST read! Long, but so worthy.
Bernie has no moral standing to say ANYTHING about Flint when he has his own Flint skeleton in the closet. I hope it comes up at the debate.
@ChrisJansing why don't you report on Bernie's REAL average donation? You can actually check the FEC inquiry! Howbatthat????
@mars_vzx @Debi129 @BernieSanders Why is anyone else entitled to evolve in their views but not Hillary? Bernie is all for firing the Flint,
@mars_vzx @Debi129 @BernieSanders As I said, you can't be selective. Bernie hasn't been vetted. You must not watch @MSNBC aka Bernie Central
@mars_vzx @Debi129 @BernieSanders Once the media stops their honeymoon with Bernie and start vetting him, THEN we can talk about hypocrites.

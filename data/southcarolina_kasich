A ticket of Trump & Kasich yes!!!!!!!!
For me, Bush; Kasich, Carson are out ! Then, ranking the ones remaining are Cruz, Trump, Christie, Rubio in that order of choice !!
How does the RNC & ABC justify Fiorina not being in the msin debate Saturday when She out performed Bush & Kasich in Iowa !!
Why is Carson & Kasich in the main debate when Carly Fiorina scored higher than either of these two in Iowa !! This is BS !

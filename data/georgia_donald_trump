@mitchellvii he can can put this thing away and focus on Hillary ..Trump playing chess while the others are playing checkers
@mitchellvii WOW watched the whole rally .. the Sessions endorsement is a power move going into Tuesday Trump wants to put this away .. so'
Chris Lawrence Retweeted Doug Mataconis
@Scott_AW_Brown Of course #Trump will, imo. #Huntsville is a top city to make such an statement as it has capable workers 4 that project imo
@geosplace #MakeAmericaGreatAgain is believable + hopeful when future POTUS #Trump says it's going to happen, imo.
@foxnation how patronizing can you get ? But that has nothing to do with why Christie backed Trump.
@weeklystandard stop running this... Very dishonest ... Already disavowed several times... Weekly Standard anti-Trump attack. Predictable

@stephenfhayes where the heck is this "pro-Trump shilling" going on?Certainly not on Fox...
- @RT_America US Hispanics rank Donald Trump last as presidential candidate – poll  As they should.
Why does the MSM show how big Bernie Sanders crowds are and purposely not show Donald Trumps?
@mitchellvii any attack on Trump especially the GOPe only drives his nos up .. they still havnt gotten it is why they cant win a election
Ted Cruz keeps saying hes the only 1 whos beat Trump ... what a fool hes hanging on to Iowa win that he stole from Ben Carson #Idiot
Donald Trump has 100% name recognition  thats YUGE!!  #Trump2016
@drvox I’m liberal and prefer Trump. He came out with a nutty tax cut, but he could walk away. Immigration is the only thing he cares about.
@greta I hope you call him out on his ridiculous response to Trump's Nevada win. His bias against him is astonishing .
@Morning_Joe here's an idea: maybe Trump will win and get things done! Why do you all act like that's not a possibility! All gloom and doom

Not sure Trump can run for President. His mother was a Scottish immigrant. He many not be a natural born citizen. #Marcomentum
@dmataconis @JazzShaw you’re correct and they’re failing miserably in stopping Trump
If Israel could vote TRUMP wouldn't have to campaign it would be automatic
TRUMP winning SOUTH CAROLINA is a vote saying how much SOUTH CAROLINA doesn't like the governor an senator Scott
GOP is like an alcoholic in denial when it comes to TRUMP
@JoeNBC would have probably gone with bush...but along came Mr Trump.
Double OT defeat. And a penis dressed up as Donald Trump.… https://www.instagram.com/p/BCCPKmRlEyES-pQANmS1rjjZOeIjl5hvGlKLW00/ …
@marthamaccallum agree but did spend millions on attack ads. A bit hypocritical to have others do dirty work. At least with Trump, up front
@stephenfhayes you mean Rubio from his talking points?People like that Trump speaks his mind without caring what you guys think. Not bought
@seanhannity Sean, why did you guys keep saying how close it was at 7:00? Trump won by double digits. Media is not to be trusted .

I might have said this before, but if Trump or Cruz wins the nomination, the Republicans will need to consider adding super delegates.

@foxandfriends @ainsleyearhardt Hi Ainsley, #HappyFriday my ?; It appears the Pope is forcing a choice between him and POTUS Trump. Agree/No
@trumwill yeah, if we have either Trump or Hillary, it’ll be nonstop drama.
The Pope says that Donald Trump isn't Christian. I say that he is, he's the #traditional conservative Christian like the KKK.
@EWErickson can't figure out why the dr. Is still up there and trump is the only guy that has a set of ball's but guys like you throw him
@FoxBusiness @POTUS No, i disagree. The very fact that no established political figure wants or believes that #Trump is fit, is why he wins.

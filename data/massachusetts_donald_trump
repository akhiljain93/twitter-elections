@chriscesq I wonder how gracious Trump will be once he realizes that he has enough delegates to coast to the nomination.
@chriscesq I’m too lazy to run the numbers, but if trump wins 90% of delegates on Super Tuesday then Rubio’s gonna have a math problem.
like how is anyone surprised that donald trump is leading the republican party when the same country voted for taylor hicks as american idol

“@realDonaldTrump: Never let them see you sweat! pic.twitter.com/NQRtP9rWfP”didn't see Trump interrupt but Rub's & Cruzy did!
Trump knows his platform reaches them, and he was smart enough to see his platform was needed by the media
Trump has done nothing but barb and attack his opponents and that's what the media loves. Any other year Trump is once again a non factor
@CNN the biggest insult is to the American people for allowing the attack of #trump rather than focus on issues
@FoxNews @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump the only thing I see through is all the  that the frightened GOP is hurling at #Trump
@IngrahamAngle #trump is clearly speaking what the public feels everyone else is so afraid GOP is changing for the better
Not a Cruz fan, but STOP Trump: “@tedcruz: Donald Trump and universal health care... #GOPDebate https://amp.twimg.com/v/d681030c-9187-4acc-9ab5-e24b94764453 …”
@JusReign CNN was trying to call Trump on his hypocrisy on Mexico. Not actually talking shit about Canada. <3
trump talking about the wall on the mexican border "maybe I'll get Canada to pay" #RepublicanDebate
Trump: Me and my plan have a lot in common. We are both simple.
Trump to Rubio "I've hired thousands of workers, you haven't hired any" Rubio to Trump "Yea but many of them were illegal from Poland"
Trump says we don't have good healthcare, but this is the country that invited the HurryCane

These types of attacks instigated by the Republican party elite, Cruz and Rudio should not be unexpected or carry weight. No credibility.

http://a.msn.com/r/2/BBpYlIA?a=1&m=EN-US … Cruz has no compromise to him. Compromise is an essential asset to any president. He looks and acts fanatical.
Kettle can't call pot black. Cruz is just as likely to start another ground war, insult the world w/o sensible diplomacy or worse.
. What a dilemma the Republicans face.They revile T-Rump and dislike Cruz about as bad..What to do what to do?

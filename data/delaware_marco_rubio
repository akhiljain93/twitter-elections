Had a great time at team banquet last nite. Congrats to our award winners and especially to our 3 seniors Marco, Luis, and Dan.
@Richzeoli the headline "Great Latino Hope of America" is the clearest example of media bias. Where were these headlines for Cruz and Rubio?
If Hillary picks Julian Castro as her VP, any GOP nominee not named Cruz has to pick him or Rubio as VP @richzeolihttp://money.cnn.com/2016/04/22/news/julian-castro-hud-secretary/index.html?iid=surge-grid-dom …

Hard for Thibs to play MIN core more minutes than they saw after AS break: KAT 35.7, Wiggins 35.1, LaVine 35.0, Rubio 31.0, Dieng 30.0.
Can you imagine waking up and having Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Ricky Rubio, the 5th* pick in the draft, and $50 million? Not bad.
@DecisionDeskHQ @VictorB123 and the #CruzCrew will blame Rubio somehow ...

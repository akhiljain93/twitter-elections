@kasinca @RepubsRScum I've blocked many BS supporters too. Bernie is the one being negative. He implies corruption that doesn't exist.
@tracyinarkansas @WPJohnWagner @ninaturner @repjohnlewis Your talking points mean nothing to me. Bernie has done NOTHING for my community.

So much for Sanders being against corporate donations... what a hypocrite. http://fb.me/73WrxSlEk 
@joemertes I see nothing at all from the others. Sanders has spoken to the issue and I've seen no proof of him being mercurial or fickle.
@NaphiSoc @sascat Bernie is not trying to change the rules. The superdels CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT.  That's the rule.
This fool really just said its racist of black people to vote for Hillary and if they arent racist they'll vote for Bernie

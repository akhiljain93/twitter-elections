Oh Snap Bernie's taking over #DEMTownhall bc corporate media @ChrislHayes wants to question our 50 state strategy and pump a false narrative
And good for Bernie to shut down @chrislhayes bringing up the absurdity of "poor voters" gate. Going to be a long hour for Hayes I'm afraid
Hayes is utterly subservient to Sanders. He should not have done this. I'm embarrased for him.
In case you;re wondering Sanders did NOT agree that the person with the most votes and the most pledged delegates should be the nominee.
fwiw, bernie sanders won't be supporting the green party. he'll back the democratic party and its nominee.
Sanders at #DemTownHall: if I don't get the most pledged delegates getting the nomination will be difficult. Um yeah you think?

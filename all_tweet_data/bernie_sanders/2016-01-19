Also: he’s the *radical* in the race. If anyone’s going to push for reparations, it’s Sanders. That’s why I hold him to a higher standard.
So Sanders favors what are effectively reparations but he's a supremacist cus he doesn't formally say "reparations?" http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/bernie-sanders-reparations/424602/ …

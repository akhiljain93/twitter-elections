Clinton leads Sanders in the new @bpolitics/DMRegister Dem poll 45% to 42% http://bloom.bg/1UyD71h 
Sanders is within MOE of Clinton, but Ann Selzer is predicting 38% first time caucus goers, which probably hurts Sanders.

Bernie Sanders due on stage here in Cedar Rapids any minute. Wonder if he will mention O'Malley after poll shows they may have the balance.

@RalstonReports This is off, or why is Bernie acting so desperate? More cheating & lying in past few days than before. What does HE know??

Bernie Sanders And Elizabeth Warren May Have Just Saved Consumers $14 Billion http://huff.to/1QzGFiW 
Clinton/Bernie being well within MOE in this DMR poll is going to drive me crazy over the next few days.
@Women4Bernie @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders Bernie is a leader not a ladder climber!
It's a nice thought, but Bernie Sanders can't win. (So says the sage of Chicago, @ericzorn.) http://fw.to/2bcyNRI

Hillary and Bernie neck and neck in Iowa. Clinton ahead with a 3% lead ahhhhh #DMRpoll
So @DMRegister has it virtually neck and neck, Clinton 45% and Sanders 42%
Iowa gold standard Selzer poll is out and Hillary leads 45% to Sanders 42 % and O'Malley at 3%.  Race is stable since last Selzer poll.
Hillary isn't making sense. How does 'debate' on Bernie's single payer plan equal Obamacare repeal? http://ppr.li/r?trail=contributor%3Dtwitter%3A146060152&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailykos.com%2Fstory%2F2016%2F1%2F30%2F1477293%2F-Hillary-isn-t-making-sense-How-does-a-debate-on-single-payer-equal-Obamacare-repeal&urlhash=ea6d9660&src=paperli.share …
@ohcrapitspete you didn't think Kirk was a Bernie kind of guy, did you? I thought he was more Jeb though...
@freddiedeboer Re: Clinton vs Sanders Politically, my view is HRC > Sanders. BUT the vitriol vs Sanders from HRC folks is ridiculous.
Clinton started organizing in Iowa in March 2015. Bernie in November. Anything short of a decisive Clinton victory is shocking #iacaucus

@BreitbartNews @joelpollak  Immune from a Trump attack?   There is plenty of opposition research on the communist Sanders yet to come out!
It's funny,  I haven't seen any Clinton, Trump, Cruz or Rubio marches going on across the USA lately. Just Bernie ones.  #NotMeUs #Bernie
When O'Malley's voters are asked their second-choice option, they split between Clinton and Sanders, Iowa Poll shows
Most important data point now in IA Dem caucus is who O'Malley supporters are backing on 2nd ballot - if they all go Bernie, he likely wins.
Democrats: Hillary 45 percent, Sanders 42 percent and O'Malley at 3 percent

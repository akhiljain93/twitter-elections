@Lucretius4 @Fixer_guy Bernie a threat to the pork & the gravy
"my aunt is voting for bernie and her husband for trump" "see I wouldn't let politics get in the wa-" "yeah but she also wants a divorce so"

Larry Sanders Show is the high watermark of 90s TV for me.Opened a door that's never been closed.The first of its kind. The BEST of its kind

Just compared google accounts of "berniebot" and "bernie bot" vs "clintonista". Clinton fans appear to be 6x more fond of insults.

@NaphiSoc Bernie fans ignore delegate math. They're cheerleaders relying on momentum, enthusiasm, and headcount at the latest Bernie rally.

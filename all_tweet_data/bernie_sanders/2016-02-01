One final thought:  If O'Malley begins to show greater strength than 3-5%, it's bad news for Sanders, not Clinton.
In December, Sanders's campaign posted a long, feminist defense of Hillary Clinton http://www.vox.com/2016/2/1/10886978/bernie-sanders-longest-ad-iowa-feminist-clinton … … #iowaToday #CaucusForBernie
My predictions: GOP: 1) Trump 2)Cruz 3)Rubio 4)Rand 5)Carson  Dems: Bernie over Clinton, despite O'Malley voters help Clinton.  #IowaCaucus

Bernie’s Revolution vs. Hillary’s Getting Things Done http://nyti.ms/1NLeFnT 
Excited about tonight! Let's go Bernie!! I'll be watching @TYTNetwork live tonight! #FeelTheBern #CaucusForBernie #IowaTODAY @SenSanders
If Sanders wins, he will immediately need to barnstorm the South. He needs to split Hillary with the Southern Democrats.
Why do we, as a UNITED country, give Iowa such power over the election? Just let Bernie and Hillary fight it out 'til November.
Intriguing parallels between rise of socialist Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn. Both driven by idealistic youth rejecting politics as usual
The only people who support Sanders are high schoolers and college kids looking for free college. Listen up shitheads cause you're bouta

Bernie Sanders made the only attack on Donald Trump that actually worked http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-minimum-wage_us_56afcc13e4b0b8d7c2303e12 … …Its true its true
@ShutUpAndrosky I remember the exact day when bernie sanders and lizards were equal
Official Prediction: Sanders by a small, but higher than expected margin. Trump, followed by Cruz then Rubio then Paul.
#ImWithHer  Because Bernie is promising a pony, with magic single payer dust. We need a pragmatic POTUS.
@BlueWaterDays Well if this was the case, Bernie would tank!
I'd watch the hell out of a channel that straps #GoPros to Clinton/ Sanders supporters & broadcasts their persuasion of uncommitted voters.

"..Chris Mathews: Bernie is old & look old." cannot stand Chris & they way he always mocks #Bernie2016 #BernieSanders #FeelTheBern
Bernie Sanders has a consistent history of fighting for the people, not the 1%. #CaucusForBernie #IowaTODAY
If you support Bernie remember he's a socialist. You know who else was? Nazi Germany and Hitler. Good choice..  pic.twitter.com/HZKwglL33Q

@_iSmokeBluntzzz caucus for Bernie !
The shoe's on the other foot. If #Bernie wins tonight we'll have to tell #hillaryPeople to stop smearing the inevitable democratic candidate
@LiebermanJeremy @DylanRatigan @fullofbalogna I disagree about putting Bernie in that category. Bernie does not have such negatives.
Trying to figure out why Bernie Sanders is on the Democrat ballot when he's a self proclaimed Independent Socialist
I don't think O"Malley will drop out. I think he thinks he can beat Sanders so when HIlliary ends up indicted... @ProfessorRobo
Almost everyone I've encountered in IC is motivated for Bernie Sanders! #FeelTheBern

#CaucusForBernie in #IowaTODAY because #Iowa loves Bernie and Bernie loves #Iowa! He is not for sale!
Bernie Sanders cannot do it alone, but together we can do anything. #CaucusForBernie #IowaTODAY
@pourmecoffee @KinderEric I would sit out if it were #prochoice trump vs pro-choice Sanders
How could any sane individual, support an agenda based on racism, income inequality, injustice & bigotry being espoused by the GOP? #Bernie
How different are the dress codes at the Trump vs. Bernie caucus after parties? Struggling with this
My take on Iowa: Cruz, Trump, Rubio. Hilary over Bernie by a small margin.
Bernie Sanders promises to fight to the convention: "We have the resources, we have the energy to continue the... http://bit.ly/1Szhdff 
Love yourself and vote for Bernie #FeelTheBern
@RobHoey Bernie is a socialist/communist and that form of government has never worked in any country that tried it
Just FYI: Sanders has to win Iowa tonight.

@nicoleefrankss I failed math for a reason
Bernie Sanders and his vision for America brings Democracy back into the hands of every single voter.  That's a Revolution worth voting for.
Sanders may be polling higher than H against repub candidates right now but watch his favorables sink when the fox/rove machine turns on him

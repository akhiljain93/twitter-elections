Lol at Hillary crushing Bernie in Florida, why don't they go ahead and call that for her. #PrimaryDay
For Dems: Bernie needs at least 1 win today. If he wins 2  (esp. #IL) & >320/691 delegates, he's good. He can win 8/10 of next. #PrimaryDay
152K votes in: Clinton 69%, Bernie 30%. 1/3 of those votes are from Cuyahoga County, where Clinton is getting 73% of vote #OHprimary
Sarasota County Results: 93 of 99 precincts reporting: GOP: Trump, 47.29%; Rubio, 24.31%. Dem: Clinton, 61.11%; Sanders 37.27%

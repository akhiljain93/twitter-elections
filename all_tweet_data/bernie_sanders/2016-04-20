Sanders losing isn't the end of the world, but its when you fail to address how you are failing to attract youth voters. You're in trouble
A President Hillary Clinton should consider that Bernie made victory more difficult & ponder why. Consider reshaping some of her policies
Hillary Clinton doesn't have our best interest. Bernie the way to go
With California - 400 delegates plus- the last state in the race this year unlike 2008, Bernie has every right to go until the end.
In half contests so far, Clinton has done better than her polling average. In half, Sanders has done better. (1/2)

@tomloverro In all D open primaries. Bernie won 70%+ votes from Independents. If NY was open primary, result would have been different.
@Mimzy122 @BryanDawsonUSA Sanders might even have less votes if all caucuses votes were counted.
Ignorant Hillary supporters. Bernie is a once in a life time candidate. And you let him slip.

How can I not be proud of #NY? Hillary won the money spots, yes.  Bernie won the soul of NY state. #NYPrimarypic.twitter.com/lGoMUD9PDs
But again, you'd rather listen to Arthur Chu write about the schadenfreude of Bernie Voters than actually address that shit so miss me.
@cherubrockstar Bernie has no oath towards victory. He now has to win every remaining primary by close to 70%. Un doable.

Question: if its Hilary against Trump and not Bernie, are yall still gonna vote and vote for Hilary or not vote at all? 
@kittenwithawhip @hels I feel the same way. But some of the harshest Bernie bros in my social feeds are women. Hilary is a lightning rod.
I just cannot fathom one reason why anyone would vote for someone besides Bernie. I can't understand for the life of me.

So if Bernie Sanders loses the Democratic nomination, he can still run in the general election as an independent ?

@mack_sanders i love your poems, they are so heartfelt
@MT50000 As I am about Bernie losing Maryland and a few others, close in Jersey. But he's been gaining crowd. That you cannot deny.
And even IF you're pointing and laughing at the misfortune of Bernie Bros, consider the fact this shit is why Gerrymandering is so powerful?

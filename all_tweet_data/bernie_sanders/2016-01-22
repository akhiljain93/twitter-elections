@dominictarason @m_m_myers for a Bernie primary loss. Sort of "you didn't vote for my candidate, now get fucked".

@WayneEdH So she didn't endorse Hillary. She agreed with things Hillary said. But Warren wants to go further. So does Sanders.
Funny how Clinton and her henchmen went batshit on Bernie the day after NH poll showed him 17 points ahead. Weird. #tytlive

All these celebs who want Bernie to be our next president should take into consideration 50% or more of their income will be taken from them
If Hillary beats Bernie in Iowa, it's over for Bernie.
The thing is, Hillary only changes her opinion for votes and sanders mostly sticks to his opinions. Mostly.

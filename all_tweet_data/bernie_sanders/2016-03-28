@ConsiderThis1  if HRC goes untouched a lot of democratic voters will leave party. I  truly hope Bernie is our next president.
people who ask "how is Bernie gonna pay for all this?" need to look at all the countries with lower GDP than the US who pay for it just fine

Bernie Sanders cares so much about free college, then he needs to also include back paying the millions who paid for it the old fashion way.
For any conservatives who ever cite "the liberal media", why doesn't this media cover Sanders much?  Not liberal enough?
#ToneDownForWhat ?! Debate him U flip flopping,inconsistent,liar! Oh, now I see why she doesn't want 2 debate Bernie pic.twitter.com/xRrWDwe5Xw
Bernie's fans don't get it. He's trashing the Democrats, while suing the DNC. So hypocritical #ToneDownForWhat

@sorensen_chris if it was anyone else I could buy it. But this is the same guy who said Sanders is the most negative campaigner in history.
@RadioGuyChris Bernie is my candidate, but that's funny. Nice to see some trolling that's actually funny.
Clinton agreed to a town hall on FOX, after Sanders indicated he would appear.  Sanders should set up a debate with Trump now.

How can you possibly support Hillary when she won't debate Bernie because of his "tone"? Is that who you really want to be president? Soft.
@4politics2 Bernie caucuses w/ Dems. He is now a registered Dem. He is more of a D than these blue dog Dems.

#ToneDownForWhat I advise Hillary to start cooperating with us Bernie supporters if she expects us to support her if she's in the general.

@mitchellvii You may be onto something here. Cruz cries cause Trump doesn't talk policy and then spends all his time NOT talking policy. Odd
@vikingdrewby yes! It was a Ted Turner invention, that 5 minutes later thing.
The only policy #Cruz has now is BASH TRUMP! It's really sounding pathetic. #WIprimary #Milwaukee there's a reason all of DC dislikes Cruz!

Never thought I'd say this - I disagree with Rubio on almost everything, but respect him more than Cruz because he doesn't constantly lie.

Jindal calls out Cruz for 'lying' about Rubio's record http://fb.me/4HbnsEIA4 
Cruz doesn't really have any memes, this is true, but being the Zodiac killer is pretty notable all by itself
@amandacarpenter Rubio has 2 less delegates than Cruz and is tied with him in SC. So, if he doesn't have a path, how does Cruz have one?
@mitchellvii Ted Cruz lie so much that he believes, Trump for president the best of all, make America great again#Trump 2016.

Just got a fundraising email from @AlexConant called “Ted Cruz is a liar” and asking people to help fight Cruz’s lies. Wow. Gloves off!
@AG_Conservative @proteinwisdom "Cruz lied" is just standard Rubio team dodge at this point.
Can Jeb, Kasich, Carson, Rubio or Cruz beat Hillary? - maybe, but not likely.  Mr. Trump @realDonaldTrump will annihilate her!!!

I'd sure as Hell support Cruz if it winds up him. We cannot afford to let the flames of war continue to burn while we sit here clueless.

New rumors of Cruz still courting Rubio for his support, but with no hard promise of a VP slot. Rubio should not trust Ted with anything!
@Donald4Change @DebAlwaystrump @tedcruz Hey take it back! Read my feed! I'm definitely NOT a CRUZ fan. Live in TX. Want him gone!
#greta Cruz started it postg Melania first on GQ

So Ted Cruz is warning Trump not to go after Heidi because she's out of his league. That's a hoot!! No Trump will expose her & Cruz in NWO
@see_soonya @mjb65023 bingo. Cruz cheats in caucuses
If the GOP elite ignore Trump or Cruz & bring in their own candidate in a brokered convention the GOP is done.
@greta @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @FoxNews Not exactly, Super PAC that ran ad is NOT a Cruz Super PAC.  Keep working for Donnie though...
@greta @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @FoxNews when did Cruz take a swipe at the stubby fingered ones wife? #NeverTrump

@MRMitchnet @repmom2 yes,#WeLoveTheTrumps Ted! Instead of Jeb!
Thank GOD - GOP shifts support behind Cruz: http://reut.tv/22wGTQP  via @ReutersTV
Typical media, now on @greta they subtly paint the picture as if it's #Cruz that wants to discuss issues, while #Trump is a joke. #Trump2016

@LI_politico The important statistic is that there is at least one Ted Cruz too many in America.
@greta @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @FoxNews More like "Cruz swipes at Melania, Trump responds in kind".  But Trump was too much a gentleman.
@greta @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @FoxNews Cruz should've disavowed the ad.

@BlasDoug @DRUDGE_REPORT his favorability has gone up and is now about to surpass Cruz, if you were to actually look at recent data.
Ted Cruz & Jeb Bush one on the right one on the left they will never make a decision that will be good for the people @realDonaldTrump
You can't serve both God and money. When Cruz was asked about his life goal? "To make more money than my wife someday"...
@gabe1925 @zip90210 extremely true. GOP establishment hates Cruz even more than Trump. Trump is ahead so they focus on him.

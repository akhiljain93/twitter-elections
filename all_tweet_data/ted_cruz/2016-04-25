It's totally unfair for Cruz and Kasich to work together to stop Trump. Real fairness is winning the nomination with 37% of the vote.
Attention Cruz and Kasich supporters: read your e-mail CAREFULLY so you don't get confused about who they say you have to vote for now.
That Cruz/Kasich plan reads like something out of a Mario Party strategy guide.

Saturday. 2 AM. Cruz looks over at the only other person in the bar. Kasich turns around. Their eyes meet. Cruz shrugs. They leave together.
I suppose the Cruz/Kasich deal is smart, but I wonder if being so public about it is smart as opposed to coordinating behind the scenes.

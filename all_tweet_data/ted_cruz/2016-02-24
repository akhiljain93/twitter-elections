@GregAbbott_TX @AndyWendt @TexasGOP @tedcruz  Sorry Gov. Abbott no disrespect to you just not feelin Ted. #TrumpTrain
@realDonaldTrump Maybe because Texans don't think anyone who's not from Texas is bad. Maybe Cruz actually does the job he said he would.
@realDonaldTrump Do you know what happened on this date 180 years ago at the Alamo, you yankee fuck? NO? That's why Texans vote for Ted.
The new joke poll out of Texas showing Cruz with a 15 point lead over Trump also has Rubio at only 8%.  COMPLETE JOKE.
@TheRightScoop @CharlesHamerle I'm for Cruz now, but in Donald's defense I think failed former nominees should keep quiet!!!

I can only hope that Kasich, Cruz, Trump, Clinton and Sanders don't win the presidency.
@FoxNews @mviser the voters didn't give him the delegates so Cruz subverts the voter to get delegates.
@top_pix @DrottM @Always_Trump @SteveHouseGOP Maybe next time the Trump campaign will list Trump delegates and not Cruz delegates.

@ameripundit Honestly, some Cruz supporters read dangerously close to borderline personality disorder. It's frightening.
@EricaGrieder @largebill68 Ah, the more fundamental point that he's taking votes from Cruz. Makes sense. I don't get why he's still running.

Cruz scares me more than Trump.  Cruz actually believes what he says, not convinced Trump always does.
So if history repeats itself we can expect Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton to not win their party's nomination. Iowa usually picks the losers.
RT @LibyaLiberty: Just heard Ted Cruz's first words on his Iowa caucus win: "To God goes the glory."   That's Republican for "Allahu Akbar!"
I have no desire to tweet anything even remotely political. That being said, Ted Cruz looks like someone who farts on airplanes.

@DanJoseph78 who isn't running a "misleading" campaign? Rubio politicizes Cruz voting against Def. Spending & amnesty support. Both untrue.

@cspanwj Do I root for Trump tonight? It could be the end of the GOP. Or do I root for Cruz, who will keep the party hanging on by a thread?
My advice for Cruz and Rubio supporters: stop with the implausible theories of either beating Trump. They will never materialize. Get real.

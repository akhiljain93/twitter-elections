Lame Cherry: Ted Cruz Anointing Just Looks Greasy http://lamecherry.blogspot.com/2016/03/ted-cruz-anointing-just-looks-greasy.html?spref=tw … Christian Cruz supporters MUST READ~surely you know in your spirit
@EWErickson To paraphrase his statement: If you vote for Rubio instead of Cruz, you will one day have to answer to God.
@maxlydic @jjmfry @BeverlySimcic Yes, Cruz, Rubio & Kasich were all copy cats last debate. So obvious they were stealing all of Trumps ideas
@Montanabeef @Saint_Obama @EWErickson @allahpundit so Kasich says to vote for Cruz in IL, MO and NC?

I'm afraid Trump would start WW3. But the scariest thing he's done is make Ted Cruz seem moderate. That guy's aiming for WW4.

No, not "anyone but trump," because candidates like Cruz have rhetoric that is just as misogynistic, racist, and classist as he does.
I'm for Trump. I will vote Cruz if he's the nominee. My Mom's for Cruz. She will vote Trump if he's the nominee. We have an understanding.

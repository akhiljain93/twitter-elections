Cruz cannot win.  He did not take a SINGLE COUNTY in a state that voted 75% Evangelical.  Don't waste your vote.  Beat the GOPe. Join us! :)
@RandPaul for God's sake Rand it's time to stop being salty over not winning the nomination and endorses Cruz. We need to stop Trump
@davidfrum Except that Rubio has a shot at winning, and Cruz does not. Cruz won't have support in the north, lost to Rubio in the south.
just viewed a "religious liberty" vid made by cruz & those who endorse him & i honestly would rather bathe in acid than ever watch it again
Please universe let Marco Rubio win the GOP primary. I could live with him as president, or hell even Cruz, but please not Trump.

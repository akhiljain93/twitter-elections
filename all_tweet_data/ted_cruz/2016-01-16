Mark Levin is stupid to think the Dems wouldn't bring suit against Cruz birth issue. Trump isn't attacking Cruz, he's protecting the party.

Good reaction from Cruz Azul. You didn't see that under Tena or Bueno. Definitely an imprint of Boy's attitude.
@Mansstory2 @EileenTownsend4 Well that's thoroughly disappointing, Ted Thought you were smarter than that.
Telling t truth, but spreading lies like Trump is doing I didn't expect from t Donald! Cruz must b making him very nervous to spread lies!

Cruz uses bible for everything EXCEPT when it comes to being ineligible. Natural Born vs naturalized is defined by St Paul in ACTS 22:25-28
@mavsmum You are always welcome, my friend. I loathe Ted Cruz, because he lies even about the circumstances of his birth.

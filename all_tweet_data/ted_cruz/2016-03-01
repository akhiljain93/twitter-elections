Wow those are some sweet Internet burns, Bro. These childish yet HILARIOUS comments almost make me believe that you're respectful and funny
@SlightlyPoetic But Ted has done good stuff in his life, and anything is better than Rubio I know that much. Cruz is much smarter than Rubio
@Salon There is not one peron; on your entire staff, as smart as Ted Cruz.
@tedcruz @heidiscruz Slimy ted. Crook fraud. LIAR

ZU GEIL: ‘Donald Drumpf’ Is Beating Rubio and Cruz for Second in Google Searches http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/upshot/donald-drumpf-is-beating-rubio-and-cruz-for-second-in-web-searches.html?_r=0 …
the only real justice we will ever get is if "ted cruz is the zodiac killer" becomes as ubiquitous as "barack obama wasn't born in the us"
Ted Thompson just signed another free agent.

@joshdill64 @schmiedsrr @mariondbrown how many court rulings will it take before the blinders come off? Cruz is a #NaturalBornCitizen

Say what you will about Ted Cruz, but that man's campaign headquarters is COMFY AS HELL pic.twitter.com/gdeKn5n3wk
Typical- @FoxNews carrying live coverage of Trump  and Cruz evening headquarters. Biased much?
#Packers GM Ted Thompson gets his top free agent signed more than a week before the start of free agency. Off to a good start.

If Cruz were to lose Texas, I'd give up beer, sex and cigarettes for Lent! #BernieSanders #FeelTheBern A girl can dream can't she?
@Unruly_Govern @SydDaniels @SpeakerRyan exactly the reason we need Cruz. He is  lonely freedom fighter in the den of lions. #NeverTrump
@Kimber_G @ChrisLoesch Are you really that naive? They dug up "ammo" on a Mormon last time! Cruz will get attacked as much as anybody.

Trump is a greedy you-know-what but he can't get too greedy. He'll want Cruz win in TX so Cruz stays in race and continues to split vote.
Rly tho if Rubio got the nod I could deal, he's not too bad at times.. But hayyyle no to Cruz HillDawg or the Bern
Hillary loses 2 Cruz, @BernieSanders wins over Cruz by 10 points. Get friends & go #VoteTogether now! #SuperTuesdaypic.twitter.com/pkZnK96y7d

@Conservative4MI @SenatorRonbo @NolteNC You're a real knee-slapper aren't ya? Nice try bozo. Cruz is sleaze, America knows it.

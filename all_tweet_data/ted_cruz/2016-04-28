@mitchellvii  My impression of Cruz watching a game: "DID YOU SEE THAT? IT WAS NOTHING BUT FABRIC, NO RING AT ALL! TOUCHDOWN!"
Rewatched Cruz's basketball "ring" gaffe.  That man is so annoying, I simply wonder how anyone can like him.
Cruz had chance to defend free spch Chicago, opposed it. Some constitutionalist. He's not a true conservative b/c he's not a true anything.
.@TrollColors  No, Cruz SAYS he a constitutionalist, while he takes $ from Soros & Goldman & waffles on immigration. He is globalist-owned.

Ted Cruz is so good at manipulating the rules of the game. He's going to weasle the nomination despite nobody knowing anyone who likes him
Real tired of Cruz blaming all this stuff on a super pack! He can't control this? Really? We now have someone who has no control! WANT MORE?

@JackieJackielg Cruz only condemned the PAC ad after it backfired and drew criticism to him. The voter fraud in Utah is an unrelated issue
Much as it kills me to defend Ted Cruz, I think he is well within his rights to say what he did about Trump. What... http://fb.me/4FbJU49Ud

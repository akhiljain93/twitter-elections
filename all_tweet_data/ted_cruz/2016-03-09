I'm not going to forget the GOP politicians who thought Donny was a lesser evil than Cruz or Rubio. They're dead to me.

I know Levin in is the tank for Cruz like Rubio at a glory hole, but dissing Ron Paul is just wrong. he is THE constitutionalist.
@lybr3 he's had YUUUUGE (Trumpspeak) over Cruz that way. Cruz has been savaged by the MSM. He's still standing tall, though
@bennydiego Ted Cruz, he's the worse
Jeb's meeting with Cruz, Rubio and Kasich... "look, this is how you lose..."
@Wally2k316 @MissT117 @TrumpNation16 @Ricky_Vaughn99 The whole election Levin pretended he was undecided to credibly destroy Cruz opponents.
@GailBrehm bfd. That's clearly a Trump tactic to defame Cruz. But you know that. #NeverTrump Cruz & Rubio join forces= bubye baby donny

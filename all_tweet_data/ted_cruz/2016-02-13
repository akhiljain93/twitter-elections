Hey GOP, better let obama pick a justice now. You really want cruz, clinton, sanders, or trump to pick one?
Forget the constitution: Like #Cruz, #Rubio wants nomination of #Scalia's replacement left to “the next president.” http://www.nytimes.com/live/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-dies-at-79/scalias-death-jolts-presidential-race …
Cruz picks a guaranteed conservative on the SC. Trump says his abortion activists sister is the model candidate. #CruzCrew fight for this
@ToddHagopian I totally respect Ted Cruz & those who support him. I would gladly vote for Cruz if he wins the nomination.

Y'all are missing the real bankshot here. It's not "GOP establishment gets Trump to SCOTUS." It's that, but with _Cruz._

And Cruz is already yappin about leaving the apt 2 the next prez. Stop Ted. The Senate disrespects u. The more u talk, the less they listen.
I'm sure Cruz won't let tonight go without mentioning his work with Justice Scalia. I hope his soul doesn't become a subject of  the debate.

Cruz leads Trump with very conservative voters (39-22%) and evangelicals (33-19%). Trump leads big with mainstream conservatives/moderates.
These numbers will be inaccurate because of the B.S. Cruz pulled on the "voter violation" stunt. People are pissed!!! #iacaucus

Reasons to wait for IA results: 1). Geography of Hillary vs. Bernie; 2). Cruz's supposedly better turnout operation; 3). Undecided voters.

I'm still guessing Clinton and Cruz outperform their polls. Partially b/c if turnout. Partially b/c of dumb caucus rules.

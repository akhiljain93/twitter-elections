In eight days Cruz goes from polling at 14% in Kansas to winning with 49% - Now THAT has to be some kind of record.
Trump has won several states, but Cruz is first candidate to break 50% in his win of Kansas. Something changed this week. #TideHasTurned
The FINAL POLL in Kansas had Trump +6 with a LV sample of 1000+.  This 26 point win by Cruz should be IMPOSSIBLE.

@NolteNC Wrong. When Mitt Romney is cheering for you, your establishment card just came in the mail. If Ted was genuine, he'd b attacked too
If Rubio is a "Reagan Conservative" then how's he not even competing in states where Ted's killing it? Because he cannot win. Jeesh.

Nice analysis by @secupp: Cruz can beat Trump, but not Clinton. Trump may win, but noone wants him. Rubio can beat Hillary, but not Trump.

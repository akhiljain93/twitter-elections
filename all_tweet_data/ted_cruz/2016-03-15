Sad thing is I'll probably have to vote for Cruz in Wisconsin, because like Rubio, I'm committed to voting against Trump. Unlike Cruz.
Cruz was not my first, second, third, or even fourth choice. But if your immediate goal is to #StopTrump then you need to support him.
@nerdwich Bernie wins VT. Hillary win LA and probably NYC. Cruz with Texas. Rubio gets 20% in FLA 
Ted Cruz outperforming projections in NC so far: http://thefederalist.com/2016/03/14/rubios-recalcitrance-aside-trumps-not-inevitable-even-after-tuesday/ …
I wish Cruz and Kasich would have got on board with #NeverTrump instead we will get nominee Trump. And hopefully a new 3rd party
@mrt95_ I repeat, the Republicans aren't normal. By their twisted logic, Trump or Cruz are more likely to win.

Wow! Big beautiful new Pennsylvania poll gives Trump 18 point lead over Cruz and a near majority -- 47 percent of the vote!
How does a candidate handle hecklers? Trump: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgK_XDSKjPs … Cruz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QCbpafD3Pw …
So RCP Average VERY accurate this season EXCEPT states Ted Cruz wins - then and only then is it WILDLY WRONG.  Folks, that is sketchy.
@bigblueonyou @debbieparfitt @_HankRearden excuse us for wanting to put America first.   Unlike Daddy Cruz who is a total fraud.
@MichaelCohen212  love it!  Ted Cruz shouldn't be taking his victory lap so soon. @realDonaldTrump is still winning and still on top!
Cruz has all the wrong friends. Trump has all the right enemies. Stay the course, folks. #WI was only air turbulence. We will safely land.

I agree w/Mark Levin. I'm for Cruz all the way, but I'll vote Trump before Hillary or Bernie. We have to be realistic about the future of US
@Theresa35096323 @LeahR77 lol, all you need to do is read the first paragraph and realize the agenda Coulter has against Cruz.

@BornToBeFrancy if it's Bernie verse trump, Bernie will win. Same goes for Cruz. I think the American GP is smart enough not to vote trump
Cruz is so blinded by personal ambition that he cannot see he is a Trojan Horse and not a dark horse.
@MarleyGimo She is running on the 7th district.  The 7th district has no Cruz delegates. Only Trump and Rubio.

Sleep? Sleep is for losers. Cruz sleeps. Loser. Rubio sleeps. Loser. #Drumpf #TYTLive
And if they rallied to Cruz, even if he did lose the general, the party would remain intact. It's the GOPe that won't bend, not the base
#bbcqt And then step forward Ted Cruz.

@ShaneRyanHere Bubba = Cruz. All of his colleagues think he's a douchebag and he attempts to shield it with cloak of Bible.
@CNNPolitics @Caitlyn_Jenner @tedcruz @GregJKrieg Oh, I'm eagerly waiting for a response from Cruz.

@kat_held @jwaggett chill. Chill. Also @jeremyrobmusic don't favorite this crap
My favorite uncle voted for Ted Cruz I don't know how to feel about that :(
if they cared about their party, they could have rallied to Cruz and probaby;l beat Trump. But they despise that wing.
@Retrogirl01 Asking myself is Robot Rubio so-called conservative?  He looks he's got a colorful background!  Cruz sure likes his scotch! OK
I ‍ AD readers:  Hillary Clinton is THE REVENANT Donald Trump is FURY ROAD Bernie Sanders is SPOTLIGHT Ted Cruz is that puppymonkeybaby

@tanajam GOPe could have thrown early support behind Cruz, who is a true Conservative, but no, they were holding out for CofC darling Bush.
Fox, Rubio and Cruz can beat up on Trump all night but they've lost the trust of Americans it won't work

As a post op Trans woman I'd like to share my thoughts on Caitlyn Jenner endorsing noted Transphobic shithead Cruz. pic.twitter.com/MkBd36hAPi
@AlecTheSQGamer @ExoParadigmGmr And of course, Ted from BrainScratchComms (a disliker of Sticker Star) disliked what they showed. #OnCue
@lybr3 @MittRomney It's almost like they would rather have Hillary than Cruz or Trump.  Maybe he threw 2012 on purpose.

The best people are the ones who angrily explain why Ted Cruz couldn't be the Zodiac Killer. If that's true, hotshot, why doesn't he deny it
34% of Iowa evangelicals went for Cruz; Trump 22%, Rubio 21%. But early SC exit polls have Trump ahead of Cruz 31%-29% among SC evangelicals
The reality is the party is going to try to keep Rubio alive as long as he’s viable, because the party doesn’t want Cruz or Trump. The end.
@CvStryker @realDonaldTrump wimpy Rubio and liar Cruz??  They don't belong there
SC exit polls look much like Iowa on issues. Favors Cruz but big difference is SC open primary. Be ready for anything :)

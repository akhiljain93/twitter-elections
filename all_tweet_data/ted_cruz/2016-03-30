@repmom2 That's exactly how I feel. I don't like Cruz. HE'S ANOTHER 2ND YR FRESHMAN LAWYER! WE HAVE 1 in the WH RIGHT NOW! #tcot #Trump2016

With Cruz and Trump are there even any women actually voting republican in the upcoming election?
I #WontBePunished by #Cruz #Kasich #Trump #GOP #TeaParty #RWNJs for my right to choose. I also won't vote for any of the above now or ever.

@blessmyliberty @HouseCracka @paphotog She would be the First Lady of NAU in 2024 if Ted elected/re-elected.
@seanhannity  So, you're lucky either way.  If Trump, you get the guy you promoted.  If Cruz, you finally get a conservative in the WH..

No, they don't have to keep the pledge. Trump's behavior and insulting comments especially toward Ted Cruz can't be forgotten.
This election is so scary i just hope trump or Cruz don't win they would set this country back so many years.

@FoxNews @WSJMattD4 @tedcruz If Wisconsin sticks with Cruz, they will have to be happy with a 3rd Obama term.Better think about Tuesday.

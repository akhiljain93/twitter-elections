Cruz: We won last five elections before NY and 1.3M voted for me  I used 2 get major beatings when I lied like this #TrumpTrain #AlwaysTrump
By the time April 26th is done, Cruz will be reduced to a joke. I still say he withdraws before Cleveland to claim he saved the Party.

Sean Hannity: "Senator, I don't know why you're mad."  Cruz: "Sh-Sh-Sh, Sh-Sh-Sean, let me be clear, I'm not mad at all."
1.3 million voted altogether in those 5 states, not for just Ted.  The man is SUCH a liar.  And it wasn't even 1.3 million.
Cruz keeps saying 1.3 million voted in 5 states!  Guess what, 1.1 million of those were in WI!  That leaves on only 200k for 4 other states!
Cruz lashing out at Hannity is not a good look. What a little baby! And so smug!
As he leaves presser, Cruz is asked if he's mingling w/ Washington cartel at RNC meeting. Cruz says the "grassroots" are at the RNC meeting.
Cruz: I think their ought to be a debate before the vote next Tuesday
To clarify the false/misleading Bill&Ted news: Yes we’re still working on it, no we don’t have a greenlight & doesn’t take place in the UK.
Trump just said "Lyin' Ted," so perhaps media shouldn't be talking about a turn toward a "more presidential" Trump.
Cruz to reporter skeptical of his chances in coming weks: "At every stage in this primary, folks in the press have reported we couldn't win"
- Are there any conditions under which you'd leave the race? - Cruz: Only if it's clear we're not on a path to victory. We are.

Highly recommend this TED talk I watched that talks about infidelity and monogamy.
Tonight Trump called Cruz "Senator Cruz." He has erased Cruz mentally and is now acting more "Presidential." Killary is next... #TrumpTrain

There's a poetic connection to Christ in every vote for Ted Cruz in that he will follow the Bible & the Constitution. I cannot say that 4DT.

@Marty2634 if I were advising Cruz I'd tell him to get out ASAP. He's young by political standards and is killing his image over a longshot
It now looks extremely hard for Ted Cruz to win the nomination. The most he can do is make it extremely hard for Donald Trump to win it.

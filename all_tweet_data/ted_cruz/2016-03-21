@FoxNews @foxandfriends @tedcruz I thought the speech was meant to be about Israel, Cruz as usual thinking of himself
Missed Cruz AIPAC speech, but, judging by Twitter reaction, I'm assuming he went full "plains of Megiddo" in it.
Watching AIPAC it seems clear to me Ted Cruz is the real maniac that should be kept from ever controlling lethal forces.

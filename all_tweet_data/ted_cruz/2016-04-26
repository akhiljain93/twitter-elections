I can hardly wait for Lyin' Ted Cruz's victory speech tonight, after his major schlonging. Can't make this crap up.
Cruz didn't need to do well in Acela corridor IF he had done better in the south - not a media conspiracy theory
No one has ever called it a "basketball ring" before Cruz just now in the history of basketball, politics, or words.
I don't know how anyone can bear these Cruz speeches without some kind of alcoholic numbing agent.

Did Ted Cruz just call it a basketball ring? In Indiana? Is he going to say he's looking forward to seeing the NASCARs run the Indy 500 next

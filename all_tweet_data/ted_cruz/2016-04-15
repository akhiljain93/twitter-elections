#NewYorkValues #FirstResponders #911 Watch this Interview with Sen. Ted Cruz on Good Day NY http://dld.bz/ezJSD 
Ted Cruz is boring, Ronald Reagan was not boring even W wasn't boring. Cruz is the most rehearsed stuffed shirt I've seen since Romney!
Cruz is the only candidate the media fears. Witness the way he handled C. Todd if you question why.

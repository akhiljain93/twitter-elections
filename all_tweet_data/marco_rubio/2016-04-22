Cruz, Rubio and Bush all said US-UK relationship would be unaffected by #Brexit. They are what you call real allies.

Friend on Phone is worried that Trump will be forced to take Rubio. I told her to calm down. Trump will be at 1237 before Cleveland.
Rubio will never be Trump's VP. He knows what happens when you pour water on a Gremlin. #onlyMarcopic.twitter.com/RTPzuDtOBx
I'm deeply disturbed about Cruz, I think he's becoming "Unhinged" just like Jeb & Marco. #TrumpTrain #Trump2016

The fact every candidate left wants Rubio as VP proves people voted for the wrong candidates. This election is one huge missed opportunity.
Cruz is collapsing in the polls, GOPe warming to Trump, even Rubio gives an olive branch.  Folks, Trump is going to win.
Cruz, Trump, Kasich have all now said they want Rubio for VP. If you all sooo like him, let's just give him the nomination & we all win, ha?
Today's A1 w/ @costareports: VEEPSTAKES -- Cruz & Kasich start vetting. Trump waiting. Carson out. Rubio hot ticket. http://wapo.st/1QqQr3I

I can't even imagine the negotiations going on right now between Trump, Kasich, Cruz, Rubio, and the GOP establishment.

#BlueJays still lead 2-1 through five. Marco Estrada likely done at 104 pitches. Pat Venditte up in a thin bullpen. No Chavez/Floyd
@SpecialKMB1969 @CameliaDitch Had a feeling. Looks like Rubio and Kasick are going to unite behind Trump. At least I hope.

@Cernovich As did Hillary with Obama in '08. Good on Rubio for putting his butthurt aside and seeing the big picture.
@wandaoaj Joke to think Rubio would ever stoop that low! Never in a million years.. Would Marco be VP for anyone
Marco looks like he's on track now. Hitting his spots. #bluejays

Rubio is warming up to Trump? Yeah no kidding. If you want to stay in the game, you'd better learn to deal with the team captain. Reality.

@TheDonaldNews @LindaSuhler Rubio would be smart to support that idea to back Trump.
Idk who this "Denny Smith" guy is but just by his name I can tell he's packing 8 inches

@DZwooo definitely shows 2 things: 21% of trump supporters are jews/blacks and Kashich/Rubio are solid establishment

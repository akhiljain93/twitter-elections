.SenTedCruz  Since you have 0 possibility of securing 1237, it is time for you take advice that you gave #Kasich and #Rubio, and GET OUT.
I hope Trump makes Rubio his Vice President and then treats him like a redheaded stepchild.  >"Come here Liddle Marco" >[puts in headlock]
Consider: Rubio, who dropped out on March 15, has more wins, votes, & delegates than Kasich to date. He's also been "vetted" more closely.

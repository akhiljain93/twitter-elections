Omg Ted Cruz fans aren't seriously accusing Marco Rubio of making the fake Facebook post that's an embarrassing level of conspiracy theory
@chipwoods @SteveDeaceShow Plus, Cruz is his own man, so is Tyler. He's not responsible for Carson, Rubio guys tweeted "get Carson's votes"
@Flipperoff @amandacarpenter I'm a Cruz guy, but I don't really have any negative feels for Marco or his supporters. We need them on board.

I have been viewing both Cruz and Rubio supporters over the last couple of days and imho, it's getting a lot worse.

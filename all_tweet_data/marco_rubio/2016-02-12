I agree with Rubio!  America is not socialists, if you want to live in a socialists county you can move to one!
Fortunately the GOP haven't figured out the one who we really worry about is Rubio.
Who knows how much longer Jebor Kasich stays in the race. Rubio needs them to exit & he has to inherit their supporters to have a chance.

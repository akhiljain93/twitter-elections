@SteveKornacki Rubio is twice on College Degree numbers
34% of Iowa evangelicals went for Cruz; Trump 22%, Rubio 21%. But early SC exit polls have Trump ahead of Cruz 31%-29% among SC evangelicals
The reality is the party is going to try to keep Rubio alive as long as he’s viable, because the party doesn’t want Cruz or Trump. The end.

@FoxNewsSunday @realDonaldTrump Rubio claims he will be nominated without winning a caucus or primary!  Totally Undemocratic to VOTERS BS
@Coondawg68 @natedbrbr Rubio reflects me more than GWB, McCain, or Romney, definitely more than Trump. Cruz is my choice and my vote Tues.
@realDonaldTrump Little Marco Rubio! Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing! Obama plays more golf than the guys on the PGA tour! Gotta love this guy!

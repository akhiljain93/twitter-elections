New CNN/WMUR/UNH poll out today has Trump at 34% in N.H., followed by Cruz at 14% and Rubio/Bush at 10% each.
On the other hand considering who some of these figures are, only thing worse for Rubio would be if he did get their endorsement.
Been debating this with a coworker - would you trade Rondo for Rubio straight? For me it's a yes.

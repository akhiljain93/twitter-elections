UPDATED Republican Nominee odds: Trump -600 (risk $6 to win $1) Rubio 5/1 Cruz 40/1 Kasich 40/1 Romney 80/1 P. Ryan 100/1 Carson 300/1
Bottom line - if Cruz has more delegates than Rubio after tonight, it's imperative Rubio drops and endorses Cruz. God help us. #SuperTuesday
Can't wait until Rubio doesn't win a single state. Sad!

I can't believe Trump is actually gonna win this....what happened to my boy Rubio? No way Trump can beat Hillary for President.

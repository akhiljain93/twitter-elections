MSNBC: Rising Rubio Sure to Face Heat at GOP Debate http://nbcnews.to/1SUPk1h  #p2 #topprog
@nolesfan2011 To knock it off with Rubio. Romney endorsing Rubio would attract Cruz/Trump attacks but would inoculate him from Jeb fire
Can't tell you how many messages we've gotten from people who are praying every day for Marco. We've got the best supporters in the game!
ok - i'm going to buy oil pastels from china then - i bought it in marco brand - an old brand pic.twitter.com/5798LWDa42
@Wickedjulia @bimmerella @kfaythe @ggindc @BRios82 Rubio. Cruz is not a kid - he's Joe McCarthy reincarnate (and looks like Hanover Fiste)
@nolesfan2011 Cruz could win SC, Rubio could too. Real jump ball I would think. Surprised Romney hasn't come out and told Christie/Jeb 1/2
.@steveatmguy @jmbilye1 Moreover, defeating Rubio for nomination is clear message to rest of GOP that amnesty a career-killer.

Rubio should use his opening statement to set the expectation that candidates are going to attack him tonight because they see him as threat
@truthandlogic32 I did.  You only made the case that Rubio has no experience.
@jhewitt1280 @JebBush I think he said Marco should wait his turn. This not a lunch line at school.

I don't remember @realdonaldtrump being against primary alliances when he was allying with Cruz against Jeb/Rubio/Christie/et al.

Trump is far ahead in RI & #OnlyMarco supporters are making a strong push there, we recommend voting Rubio in RI to deny Trump Delegates.

Rubio was smart to drop out while he still can save political face and his political career. Kasich and Cruz need to drop out now!
I have nothing against forming alliances like what Cruz & Kasich have, but its funny how Rubio was treated when he wanted to the same!!
Kasich has won just one state, 148 delegates (1089 short of nomination), 267,263 fewer votes than Rubio, who bailed five weeks ago.

When Trump suborned Christie to attack Marco, it was just strategy. When Kasich and Cruz make a smart play, Trump whines like a cur.
Rubio was in the Gang of 8  Now @tedcruz & @JohnKasich are in the Gang of 2 pic.twitter.com/i9TfxT9onA
Cruz & Kasich deal is "Desperation". I've never seen an election where someone says to vote for an opponent. First Rubio now these clowns.
America is exceptional! Rhode Island please vote for Marco Rubio on Tuesday! #RIPrimary #OnlyMarcohttps://amp.twimg.com/v/f0f33461-48ab-44f0-9ec9-15b5b91bdf01 …

I hate to sound salty, but I'm going to make this comment anyway. Cruz and Kasich are finally doing what Rubio first encouraged in March.

So, Jeb had zero shot but spent millions destroying Rubio who did.
@TeamTedCruz @tedcruz This worked out real well when Rubio tried this. Just drop out. You are embarrassing everybody.
I'm fine w Cruz and Kasich calling for strategic voting but I recall when Rubio suggested doing it, it was outrageous
Stephen Miller Retweeted Teddy Schleifer
Rubio camp went so far as to tell supporters to vote Kasich in Ohio. Will Team Kasich explicitly tell Indiana supporters to vote Cruz?

★  NUMBER OF STATES WON ★  TRUMP:     22 Cruz:          11 Rubio:         3 Kasich:        1
All I want is for Marco Rubio to come out and say he is unsuspending his campaign. Is that too much for a guy to ask for

Someone please order some food for delivery from Marco's
@amiller611 @__jacquelyn_ Rubio has won 3 states, Kasich only won 1. I can keep piling the facts on you. Kasich has less chance than Rubio.

@ThadiunOkona @dick_nixon Rubio really is like Dan Quayle lol. Quayle's son was a flash in the pan as well.
I suspect Rubio will come close to 20% by Monday if he gets a post debate bump. That'll put him within striking distance of Cruz.

I'm pulling for Rubio. But increasingly convinced Iowa Rubio supporters need to caucus for Cruz.
Rubio has 15% in new DMR poll, but another 20% in 2nd-choice preference. That 35% puts him even with Trump in combined #, and close to Cruz.

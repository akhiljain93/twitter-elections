It's ALREADY a 2-Man Race between Trump & Cruz!  Rubio should drop out & announce he'll be Cruz's running mate if Cruz'll have him!
If Rubio is a "Reagan Conservative" then how's he not even competing in states where Ted's killing it? Because he cannot win. Jeesh.
Keeping in mind that Rubio isn't running for re-election to his Senate seat that puts it into perspective.

Senator Rubio, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?
I think little Marco should kick Trump in the Knee. #DumpTrump
Looks increasingly likely that Cruz is only R who can beat Trump. Sadly, because I love Rubio

@JoeNBC don't sleep on Marco Rubio! Fear the one who doesn't fear the most! Marco have a strategy!? I hope lmao
With Cruz at 51% in KS, and Rubio at 15%, it'd be nice to think that the "vote-for-who-can-win-the-state" strategy is in place. But doubt it

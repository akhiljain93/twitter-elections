@FoxNews @marcorubio If he loses #Florida is Mr. Rubio willing to concede the race? He's only hurting @tedcruz at this point. Wrk 2gether
FTR: Only 'office' for Rubio campaign was in Austin. No others, as claimed by Rush, incorrectly. @SpecialReport
@davesund @DoremusJ Rubio's problem is that he went down to Trump's level but doesn't have the fortitude to stay there.
Isn't it illegal to know early votes cast prior to primary day?  The only what Rubio could win Florida is if they cheat. Yes Cheat

@baseballcrank Cruz likely better off with a 4-man race than a 3-man race. Worst case for TC: Rubio wins FL, Kasich loses OH.
Rubio has to figure out a way to rally the troops. Especially since they'll be deflated once again after tonight.
@JRubinBlogger @katiepack @realDonaldTrump this is pure spin...you have no credibility...rubio will finish 4th in michigan tonight

With Cruz putting out the rumor that Rubio insiders telling him to get out now, Cruz said voting for Rubio is a wasted vote! Sound familiar?
#Rubio needs to drop out! He's got a freaking pair of twos! He can't win!!! Ego & Stupidity!!! #CruzCrew #TedCruzpic.twitter.com/PLG2HzeCAD

AGAIN?   Rubio camp accuses Cruz of 'dirty tricks' over Hawaii 'dropout' email | http://fxn.ws/1QEYnTu 
Ettore Messina asked a small media contingent "how his boy" Ricky Rubio is doing. Says he's coached against Rubio 2,000 times, and is a fan.
@DrewMTips @CampbellKevinJ @FoxNews @marthamaccallum @JohnKasich @tedcruz prediction ...Rubio wins MI with a Fourst place finish

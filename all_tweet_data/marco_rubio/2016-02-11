@AsianAm4Trump Roboto Rubio is done. He had his Rick Perry "Oops" moment. Fully exposed to just whatever his voters want to hear. 10-faced.
First, Cruz camp spreads false rumor of Carson dropout in IA; now theyre reportedly pushpolling vs Rubio/Trump in SC. How Christian of them.

@tizzytayxo Hey, hey. That's a bit harsh. If I were to say Trump, Rubio, Cruz, then that response is warranted. Geez.
@JayCostTWS Does this mean you believe Jeb is going to best Marco in SC? Because I believe Marco has to virtually end Bush's campaign there.

While Paul Ryan and donor-class favorite Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)78%  have been Congress’s most ardent champions... http://fb.me/7UKUhkKOf 
So, Trumpies, you piled on Rubio and got him knocked out of the race. And you expect his supporters to help Trump win delegates? BWHAHAHA
Just rode another 5 miles.
Lol where marco?
@RickCanton @ZenaMorse @GOP @Reince @HaleyTessIsis @tedcruz maybe you'll bring Cruz as much luck as you did Rubio. Lol.

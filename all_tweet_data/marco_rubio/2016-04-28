@bretbaier since Ted chose Carly who has NO delegates, it pretty evident that Rubio & Kasich turned him down. @realdonaldtrump @seanhannity

Ted Cruz picked Carly Fiorina as his running mate. In similar news, Marco Rubio named Ben Carson as his.
Marco Gomez scores two and Sandro Maya gets the third as Southwind beats Sheffield, 3-0. Good win for the Jaguars!

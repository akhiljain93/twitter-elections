Tom Thibodeau as Minnesota Timberwolves head coach... with Wiggins, Towns, Lavine, and Rubio. Game over and well deserved. Unbelievable
Head Coach/Pres: Tom Thibodeau GM - Scott Layden Karl-Anthony Towns Andrew Wiggins Zach Lavine Ricky Rubio The no. 5 pick in 2016 lottery.
Minnesota’s defense with Rubio, Wiggins and Towns at the key positions is going to be downright terrifying.
Can you imagine waking up and having Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Ricky Rubio, the 5th* pick in the draft, and $50 million? Not bad.

I kept saying Cruz was in the same position as Rubio...neither were getting to 1237 but that Rubio could win a general~that has not changed.

Hey burglars, I'm never home. Signed Marco Rubio #TYTLive
Wait, Rubio is never home so he bought a gun to leave with his wife & kids? Shouldn't his wife buy the gun since she's home alone? #tytlive
@RColaCito @YouTube love it
Rubio straight owns the exchange between Cruz on immigration, even though both of their positions are filled with buzzwords and no substance
ISIS: *knock knock* Is Marco Rubio home? We would like to take over the country starting here.   Totally how it works. Door to door #tytlive

Most religious people I know get mad @ businesses staying open on Xmas eve,why's no one mad at Rubio for being part of that problem?#tytlive
Recap: Rubio is never home, but #daesh is coming to his house, and he'll shoot them while he's not there and they are. #tytlive

@palmaceiahome1  They have it wrong Rubio is a loser that won't work why should he get a promotion
Along with his fundraiser in Minnesota tomorrow, Rubio will have a brief (very early am) press avail.  http://blogs.twincities.com/politics/2016/01/07/rubio-coming-town/ …
@allisonkilkenny tbh CR is the only reason I know what's going on there - perhaps Rubio should listen in.

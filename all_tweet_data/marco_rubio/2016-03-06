@ericwburns @AviWoolf Rubio has a solid chance in NC. Especially if debate goes well TH. I'd stick with Rubio.
I wonder if Cruz, Kasich and Rubio are all saying "Please, don't let Romney endorse me".
@Tamaraw68415067 @jthurgood1 @wis10 I'm just saying, trump wants Rubio to stay in.
What a creepy guy marco rubio is!! Wouldn't surprise me if later someone discover that he uses some kind of stimulant
Rubio won Minnesota, only state to vote against Reagan in 1984, & Puerto Rico, a territory. Tell me how hes more electable than Trump & Cruz
A message  to all the morons - Puerto Ricans are U.S. Citizens. They didn't vote for Rubio bc they want amnesty.  #TeamMarco #NeverTrump

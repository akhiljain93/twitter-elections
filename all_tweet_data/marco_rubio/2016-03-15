Marco Rubio (March 8): “I believe with all my heart that the winner of the Florida primary...will be the nominee of the Republican Party.”
I'm REALLY not sure I want to be part of a GOP which treats Donald Trump like a king & Marco Rubio worse than a serf. #Absurd #Pathetic #Sad
This is real simple. Cruz beats Trump 1-on-1. Rubio and Kasich have elected Trump.

I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to do anything about it- Marco Rubio voter.
Marco Rubio should just drop out of the race already. He's losing to Trump in his own home state & miserably 
@Mind_Shaz If Kasich and Rubio pull out, more then likely there delegates will go to Cruz. 2 man race, may best man win
So embarrassing for Rubio.  #PrimaryDay

@LouiseMensch even if you directly transfer all Cruz votes to Rubio he is still some way off Trump as things stand. 42.5% vs 46.1%
Remember: had Rubio had the decency to drop out before Super Tuesday, Cruz would now be the frontrunner.

@RalstonReports Florida is a closed primary state. I think it says more about Rubio's standing among Florida Republicans than anything else.
In lieu of a concession speech, someone will remove Rubio's circuits while he sings "Daisy, Daisy ..."
@The_News_Herald And I think she's gonna be singing https://youtu.be/n6RoOwSKI7M  to Marco Rubio #FloridaPrimary
Seems like Rubio's problem was that he was a very promising Democratic politician who happened to be an extremely conservative Republican.

I almost feel bad for Cruz and Rubio, being elected officials who have actually been invested in politics, losing to an inexperiences clown
If I had the capacity to pity Marco Rubio, the Florida returns would be triggering my pity receptors.
Early voting results out of Craven County - for President - (R) - Donald Trump 45%, Ted Cruz 34%, John Kasich 9%, Marco Rubio 8%.
lmao Trump spent the day on the golf course and Rubio gave the same nothing-to-see-here answer in 24864369 interviews
I wasn't ever gonna vote for Rubio but I was rooting for him tonight just to shake things up.
I'm much less interested in the "Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday" hot take on Rubio, and much more interested in the "Ssussudio" one.
I'll be in soon. GO MARCO!!!
@KayGragg14 exactly if Rubio and Kaiset or whatever his name is just drop out Cruz would beat trump. They are splitting the non trump vote
poor rubio...id feel worse for him - had he not talked so much shit about POTUS... #PrimaryDaypic.twitter.com/ZgfSTtTPN4
I can't decide if Marco Rubio is hot or not and its really starting to affect my daily life

Perhaps Trump's call for Rubio to drop out last week was to spare Rubio the embarrassment of this defeat?
Cruz moves past Rubio in Leon County. Cruz, 28.47 percent, Rubio, 28.37 percent. Trump still up with 29.53 percent.

Riddle me this Batman... What time tonight will Marco Rubio suspend his campaign for President?
So Rubio is done. Question becomes how quickly does he make it official and how serious is he about #NeverTrump? Does he endorse?
Kasich just barely winning Ohio. Trump beating Rubio 2:1 (at this early stage). Not winning your own state is rough.
I got so lit that I think I may have broke my finger
Marco Rubio could be used to plug the hole in the dike that will have to be built around FL because of climate change. #tytlive #PrimaryDay
@RalstonReports I think the Rubio extramarital affair rumors are stronger in Florida than elsewhere. It's more of a preemptive strike
Trump delivering knock out punch to Rubio
Kasich is Ohio's favorite son. Rubio is more like Florida's second cousin.

What do you think Rubio's looking like right now lol?
Hate to admit it, but this is the end of Marco Rubio. No point in going on.
I'm with Rubio till the end
Rubio is an asset to GOP. There are reasons I prefer Cruz and still do.  Raging againt Rubio helps no one. Accomplishes nothing #NeverTrump
Low energy Jeb! and Little Marco. Trump just devastated Florida politicians.
I am not going to apologize for Florida picking Trump because you know what this means Marco Rubio is without a political career.
Can someone please tell me why Rubio is doing so poorly in North Carolina.
Rubio was stomped in Florida
Marco Rubio looks like a Ken doll. Just as fake and slippery. #tytlive

Looks like Rubio picks up no more than 70k votes in what's left to be counted in Miami-Dade. Nowhere near enough.
@AG_Conservative @marcorubio Rubio is too good for politics and his family deserves a better life. God does not make mistakes. Bigger plan
If Florida holds, this is a shame. A party that chooses Trump over Rubio is one that Reagan would not recognize.
What if Marco Rubio drops out tonight and while doing so says he is leaving the Republican Party.... It would be brilliant.
Donald Trump has called his victory, networks talking about it now, there will not be a Rubio miracle tonight, folks #FLPrimary #GHPolitics
Can Marco start a new country over a few states as a place for all of the mentally sane people to live?

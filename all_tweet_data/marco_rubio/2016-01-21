I should add that Rubio was actually my #3 at the beginning of this process. But my 1 and 2 are back in Wisconsin and Texas, respectively.

@Reince gee when are you going to list the legacy of failures from Trump, Bush, rubio, Cruz and ms failure herself, Carly Fiorina?

@Rschooley Rico would definitely be for Trump, Private for Rubio, Kowalski in love with Fiorina. If we buy the premise of GOP penguins.

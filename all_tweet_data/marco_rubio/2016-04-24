Some talk of voting for Rubio in RI. Don't. Could net Trump an extra delegate. Cruz or Kasich.

Guys, pls RT RT RT and full upmost respect to @RCornhouse for doing this! @TheLTDA @The_LCDC http://moby.to/1nv92e  via @chucklescabbie
Cruz and Kasich people are like vultures today. Rise above Rubio supporters. Rise like eagles. #OnlyMarco
Delegates are what decides if DT gets the nomination. RI delegates are given proportionately. Rubio, Cruz and Kasich can all take delegates.
Trump is 2.5 million votes ahead of #LyinTed while Rubio still leads Kasich! Time for all get on the #TrumpTrain!pic.twitter.com/LnufuClz2e

@mitchellvii Meet The Press said Trump is picking up Rubio delegates
Cruz is so practiced and rehearsed he makes Rubio seem spontaneous by comparison.

You don't have to like it, but do understand why Trump is adding electoral insurance with Rubio Once in, Donald will crack the @GOP machine
@Speshlk0510 @DebAlwaystrump I'm torn. Liked Rubio before he showed he could be bought.1000x better than Clinton though.

@hayektriangle @thebballqueen @Jennie_Cake1 @rose10052 @Sassy__Gal @cm1872 no - it would only hurt Rubio to be assoc w/ any of them

@keeponmoving16 With Marco, my children can admire him and believe in their own future.  He is a phenomenal national role model!
@thebballqueen @hayektriangle @Jennie_Cake1 @rose10052 @Sassy__Gal @cm1872 Executive? Rubio was speaker of the Hs.  And much more experience

Marco the kid wins physical battle with roughneck goliath. #RCTID
@NoBoah The final convention rules haven't been set.Marco can still be nominated. @Sassy__Gal
@JayleneKL @DebAlwaystrump  I have to say...I could stomach Rubio over Kasich. DJT made nice with Rubio recently, so looks possible 
http://OnlyMarco.com  asks strategic voting #NeverTrump'ers:  Vote Kasich in CT, DE, & MD Vote Rubio in RI Vote either in PA  (In 2nd pl)
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr PLEASE MR. TRUMP, RUBIO IS BAD NEWS!! KEEP HIM OUT OF YOUR CABINET! I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I HEARD THIS!

@CelesteHerget @worldnetdaily I thinl Trump could still choose Rubio as vp.
@suziferg0806 I voted for Rubio in the primary but I'm what is referred to in rare circles as a "realist"  Those people are BOTS
Heat were finally going at Kaminsky in the PnR in the 4th and late in 3rd and got tons of FTs and shots at rim. Was too late at that point
@PrayForMarco  How about a Trump/Rubio ticket? I could get behind that one. Marco said he would back Donald if he is nominee. Just curious.

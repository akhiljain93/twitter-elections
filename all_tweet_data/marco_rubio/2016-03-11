Ohio: Don't be fooled by Rubio telling you to vote for Kasich. It's a plot to get to a brokered convention so the GOP could nominate Jeb.

@JmeMiller1974 If not hanky-panky and blackmail, then some other kind of payoff to take out Rubio and go easy on DT for later favors maybe.
@Jackiethepaper @FLboyzmom Just because we know Rubio swings that way doesn't mean we HAVE to make fun of him.  But it is fun
Hannity is really naïve. so surprised. he doesn't realize Kasich Rubio wont quit until cruz is stopped. Then Trump wins the nomination.

Marco Rubio needs to focus more on the hip-hop vote. We all know that Rubio's idol growing up was Tupac Shakur.
Rubio, John Kasich want to take the selection process away from the people, they want a brokered convention screw the people

Marco fu , take a bow, best dish i have ever seen under the circumstances
I can't wait to see who Marco Rubio & Ben Carson are gonna pick as their running mates.
Marco Rubio has been in a great mood. Giving lots of floor speeches, talking to reporters and smiling more than he was a couple months ago

Carly Fiorina, like Marco Rubio, is a candidate professional Republicans think is appealing to voters, based on no evidence.

Hi @JohnKasich just wanted to remind you that Marco Rubio STILL has more delegates than you do, so you're doing great, please keep running.
Remember how awkward Marco & Jeb got at the end? You could hardly watch them without cringing? That's Ted. #CruzCrew http://nypost.com/2016/04/27/ted-cruz-is-crumbling-before-our-very-eyes/ …

Rubio's -- obviously -- not Reagan, but at least he gives you the electability and the conservatism instead of half a loaf.

The Trump supporters at Jabba's palace haven't been this excited since Jabba tossed Rubio to the Rancor.
Y'ALL SHOULDA JUST VOTED FOR MARCO LIKE REASONABLE HUMAN BEINGS AND WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS POSITION
Total votes so far  Clinton ———— 11.9 million Trump ———- 9.8 mill Bernie ——— 8.8 mill Cruz ——- 6.7 mill Ksich — 3.6 mill Rubio — 3.5 mill
John Kasich STILL doesn't have as many delegates as Rubio.
Kemberlee Kaye Retweeted Rick Wilson
Also, Rubio dropping removed the one candidate voice most effectively attacking Trump on a consistent regular basis.
We lost some tough contests this election, but the more I see of Trump, the prouder I am of Marco Rubio.
Cruz was supposed to do well after Rubio left, instead he demanded support instead of earning it and so he never got it.
Criticize Rubio all you want but he was making the case that Trump was *unsuitable,* not merely *unelectable.*
Conrad Close Retweeted Kyle Foley
Remember kids: no matter what happens, it's all Marco Rubio and the Establishment's fault.
I wonder if Candidates had it to do all over if they'd still spend millions taking Rubio out and ignoring Trump. Thanks guys. Great strategy
Rubio and Scott Walker saved their careers by getting the hell out of Trump's way.
Kasich will probably still be behind Rubio in delegates: http://53eig.ht/1VB5MH5  #PrimaryDay
@HawkinsUSA But I was told Cruz was going to dominate if Rubio just dropped out....
Rubio is still beating Kasich and he has been out of the race for a long time LOL
Walker Rubio Bush Perry Fiorina   Nope: We go with the psycho who is going to lose in a landslide
I have to admit that I was wrong; Cruz winning all of those states tonight really shows that Rubio did the right thing by dropping out.

Clown trump colluded with Fox news to "take Marco down" so we lost the best chance in this election. @AlwaysMarco

Cruz: "if Rubio gets out I can beat Trump" Really! It should have been the other around. Cruz is unelectable & giving DT the nomination.
its still so sad that rubio only won minnesota
Don't blame me, I voted for Rubio.
Has Bernie signed Marco Rubio's speechwriters? I haven't heard such a victorious speech from someone losing since MR exited stage right.

It was so hard seeing Marco Rubio on the ballot and not voting for him because, a vote for him would essentially be a vote for Trump.
I said please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast
@B__Marco cutie pie! God bless him
Is Marco Rubio the key to Donald Trump's demise? http://nyp.st/1VUkqJa  via @nypost   Yes.
@B__Marco beautiful!
Rubio will still beat Kasich somewhere

Cruz is doing what Rubio did bad mouthing Trump and nothing else,people are sick of it, more he speaks less votes he'll get.
Gonna be another big night for Marco Rubio.
@roaralexx actually Marco just took it and he said it was chill AF but they're not offering it in the fall.  I need an easy class.

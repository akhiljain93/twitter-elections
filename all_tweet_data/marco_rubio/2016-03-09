And at what point does Marco quit just to preserve future electability? If this keeps up, he may not get another chance at this in 4 years.
The thing about Rubio regretting his nastier Trump comments is it will be treated by media as though he regrets all Trump comments.

@baseballcrank You can't win without winning Ohio.  My original dream ticket: Kasich/Rubio. http://hill.cm/kxVGkna 
Ok the pundits say Trump at 40% has 60% against him. So Cruz and Rubio r at 20 % so that means 80% don't like them.

Rubio  won't but should drop out before Florida because he can't win except by contested convention.  So, apparently that is what he wants.
Every1 take a bow!! We ALL (every1) Earned a tie in Delegates & States won with Marco Rubio last night & he spent $10M! #Trump2016 #Trump
Has anyone noticed that Rubio's foray into playing the potty-mouthed adolescent coincided with the collapse of his campaign?

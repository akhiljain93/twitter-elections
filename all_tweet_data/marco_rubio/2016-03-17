Ok, saw a former Rubio supporter and #NeverTrump member advocating for Kasich. How was THAT supposed to play out?
The saddest part about Marco Rubio quitting politics is that we won't get to enjoy watching him suck so hard on 24-hr news cycle.
Mind-boggling how this election contains the poorest field of #GOP candidates, & Marco Rubio's political career is the one that's destroyed.

If Rubio endorses Cruz AND Kasich gets out in the next day or two, Cruz can realistically catch and pass Trump. If not, not, imo.

@thehill And this proves yet again how horrible Rubio of candidate is. He cannot face Crist in every election.
You know why Rubio doesn't want to be in politics anymore? Because you have to sell your soul.
@thehill Look Marco, quit playing the blame game... Grow up and face responsibility!!

I keep seeing that Marco Rubio is "quitting" politics. Is it really quitting if you already have no future in it? OK, I quit being a model!

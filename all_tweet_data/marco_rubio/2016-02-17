New national NBC/WSJ poll (released today: Cruz 28, Trump 26, Rubio 17, Kasich 11, Carson 10, Bush 4. It's Kasich's highest # in a natl poll
Rubio is safe space for a party afraid of its own ideological shadow. Just "I'm ok" and "you're ok". Not judging. Like a therapist.
@JayCaruso the man, just yesterday, threatened a 3rd party run. I'll sit home. Time for a Rubio Prez with promise of Cruz SCOTUS.

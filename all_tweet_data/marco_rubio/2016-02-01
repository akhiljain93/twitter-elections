The only scandal bigger than Hillary's denial of her email scandal is Rubio's denial of his support for amnesty.
Rubio is used to facing this challenge. He beat them in 2010, he'll beat them in primary, and will beat Dems and indie Trump in a general.

poll numbers for Rubio have shifted a lot in past few days - is this his long awaited surge?
After Fox voter panel almost all raised hands for Rubio after last debate, anything less than 2nd in Iowa should be considered a miss.
And Rubio will make a strong showing for third place, thanks to Trump.  He owes his boost to Trump's attacks on Cruz, not on his campaigning

Idk I got a feeling Rubio is going to pull some type of upset either today or next week.
If cruz n rubio really cared about turning america s round they would stay in senate n do there jobs they just got there go to work boys
Be smart, Iowa! GO WITH MARCO!!! #Marcomentum #Vote4Rubio #Rubio2016
@IntelliJennce Rubio is an interesting case! I'm still researching that one. I'm still waiting for real proof debunking Obama's "long form".

@BretBaier Rubio will be the big surprise winner. Cruz dropping and trump supporters won't show. Time for republicans to get sane.

Dark Horse prediction for tonight…   GOP: Cruz, Rubio, Trump.   Dems: Sanders with a (very) narrow upset.
@CLewandowski_ Dems don't trust Microsoft app are doing hard copy back up tallying.  YOU NEED to also!  Microsoft Major Rubio Donor!
Personally I'll be pretty content with the outcomes in #Iowa if Sanders wins on the Dems side and Rubio at least comes in second in the #GOP
Iowa Predictions 1. Trump 2. Cruz 3. Rubio 4. Carson 5. Paul
Hmm, Marco Rubio reminds me of a young Orson Welles. #justsaying @marcorubiopic.twitter.com/TI1DskXNTz
Never give up on the  only genius running  this year. Everyone  has a play ground. Marco Rubio still  have a chance. Plug in my solid poetry

@GirlNtheMedia @LibertyBritt Do hope they will listen to u and will caucus for Cruz, Rubio or Carson.
Not a lot going on at the Marriott downtown.  There are a few Rubio staffers here.  But a lot more press. pic.twitter.com/8zzmenHkyg

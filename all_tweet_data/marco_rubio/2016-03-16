@KennedyNation Without Rubio, the loons took over.  Sitting this one out. p.s. Never considered Rubio establishment. @KatiePavlich
@LenCollins @kristymcampbell no Floridian blames you for voting for Jeb; we blame R2R for going after Rubio and giving a pass to Trump
Real question is am I still going to get the stuff I ordered from the Marco Rubio store?

@Jason071978 @GOPAmericanMom @TheLibertyEagle I hope it has a positive outcome. Many Cruz supporters would rally behind a Cruz/Rubio ticket.

Kasich is hoping to get his delegate count higher than Rubio’s before the brokered convention. Gives him more negotiating power than Rubio.
@Fanfanaway @HEYDON Thanks, I'll pass it on to the team. And like I just wrote, come again and I'll be the happiest Marco on the planet. =)

If you'd told me six months ago that Trump and Kasich would outlast Rubio, I wouldn't have believed it.
Watching Marco Rubio's last speech as a candidate for President makes me oddly sad...he fought a valiant battle against a con man.
@acaminero3 I understand. I think Rubio will endorse him. His campaign already asked us 2 support him. If that's what Rubio wants, I'm in.

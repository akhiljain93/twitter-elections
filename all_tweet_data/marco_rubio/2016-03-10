Cruz: kid who got stuffed in a locker. Trump: kid who stuffed Cruz in a locker. Rubio: kid who ratted. Kasich: kid who watched/chuckled.

I bet Cruz or Rubio would help a woman up if she fell at one of their rallies *cough* #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@JustCrum79 @Barbara4422 she obviously does not know many people in florida. We are Marco Country.  #NeverTrump
@realDonaldTrump Little Marco will be coming at you hard tonight. It's his only chance because after tonight I predict he'll be gone. #Trump
Hmm...What are odds Rubio actually does drop out before FL & endorse Cruz to save face/set up for 2020?
Rubio has to find a way to destroy Trump tonight without looking desperate. #GOPDebate

@jayyelle94 Marco is very happy with his name. Thank you very much. 
Hey Folks they say Rubio is winning in Florida..we cannot allow that  We need to start fixing our country. TRUMP will do it.
the double sided brilliance of Urban Meyer's endorsement is it gets Kasich votes in Ohio but also pushes Kasich backers to Rubio in Florida
I refuse to search "Marco Rubio" on twitter b/c I don't want to feel sorry for him. #tytlive

If Rubio tries, it's likely he flops like Gov. Bush & Rand Paul. Trump is a pro at torching people. Senators call their enemies "my friend."
Rubio has skeletons in his "closet" If he goes after @realDonaldTrump those skeletons will be outted. @JackWillyj13

@ClayMcCreary #Rubio angers me, I'm disgusted. He's a sellout and changes policies as much as Hillary. He's no conservative. We need #Cruz

@Rfperz11 I can *maybe* explain lack of trust in Rubio as the wages of Go8. But Cruz wrote the freaking State AG amicus brief in Heller.

@KamVTV @GOP mathematically neither Rubio/Cruz can win right now based on future polls! They either want him to quit,b Cruz VP or Trumps VP!
Tip 4 chattering class: Pick FL paper, go to any article about Rubio, go to comments section, read what Floridians think. He's dead to them.

Rubio is both jealous & envious of Cruz. Cruz is what Rubio wanted be, but was to weak to stand up to Est. & sold his soul. @marklevinshow

The GOP needs to learn to quit attacking each other & attack Hillary & Bernie. Trump, Rubio or Cruz will be the nominee so work together.

@BecketAdams I'm a big Rubio supporter but I don't see Rubio as an alpha.
If Rubio were a good guy, he'd note that he's going to lose FL & would leave the race to spare us Trump. Sadly, Rubio is not a good guy.

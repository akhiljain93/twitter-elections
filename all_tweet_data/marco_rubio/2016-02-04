KARL: Why can't supporters name your accomplishments? RUBIO: Santorum endorsed me without knowing what I did, that's fine though, its legit
Five percent of NH voters say that they cannot vote for Rubio. That is nothing short of amazing considering the barrage of negative ads.
A new CNN poll on the GOP New Hampshire race gives Trump 29%, Rubio 18%, Cruz 13%, Kasich 12%, Bush 10%, Christie and Fiorina 4%, Carson 2%.

Problem for Rubio is he is letting expectations get out of control in NH, if Kasich can consolidate moderate vote could have shot at 2nd
Since Rubio's in second place and will be next to Trump, I look forward to Team Rubio urging him to attack Trump. Right guys? Right?
Are Bush, Rubio, Christie REALLY forgetting to run anti-Kasich ads in NH again? I thought there'd be more than one for sure. #GOP #2016
Christie effect? Rubio using new lines in his stump speeches in recent days saying he's "tired" of police being treated poorly
Senator Marco will lose. #Rubio camp scrambling to find one accomplishment. I predict many fabrications in #NewHampshirePrimary and beyond.
@CBSEveningNews @MajorCBS the first job of the president is to show up for work Marco!!!
@MikeMay47 @marklevinshow Levin is being pretty rough on Rubio today actually!

Scale of 1-10, how pissed is Chris Christie that Rubio is 2nd in CNN-WMUR poll while Christie is tied for sixth?

Carson doesn't look too upset using  mistake to fund raise why isn't he upset at Rubio for his involvement?

@JoeNBC Johan Goldberg summed it up perfectly about joe's softballs for trump vs obsessive hatred for Rubio.
Rick Santorum says Marco Rubio doesn’t have any accomplishments in Senate. That’s coming from an expert! #GOP

@Women4Trump He talks about TRADE and NEVER mentions the TPA that Cruz and Rubio supported????? WHAT?
@_sadiephillips Marco is mean, lets just fight him already
@UweBollocks i vote rubio. I have heath ledger joker tattoed on my lower back
@thompt06 The only main differences was a shift from Trump to Cruz and Rubio. Thus he is having a tantrum.
@DebndanfarrDeb Rubio is owned by Silicon Valley plus he was totally played by Schumer. Not a leader, a pawn.
I will say this about Rubio, his people know who to play expectations game and spin 3rd place finish in IA into win

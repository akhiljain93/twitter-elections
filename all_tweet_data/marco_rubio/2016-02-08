Kind of ironic that Christie is the one attacking Rubio on the issue of attendance when his popularity is near 30 in part due to absenteeism

Wow. Finally watched that Rubio gaff. So painful.

I don't expect #Rubio as POTUS to change DC cartel, Nor Christie, Bush or Kasich, I do expect #Cruz and #Trump to upend the apple cart.
NH polls see Rubio anywhere from solid 2nd to, like, 5th. The consequences of either would be dramatic. And... opposite.

I'm thinking that Rubio's rote, redundant, scripted short speeches, and not actually answering questions, is catching up with him.
Final GOP Emerson poll  New Hampshire  Trump 31% (-4) Bush 16% (-2) Kasich 13% (-1) Rubio 12% (+3) Cruz 11% (+3)
That latter statistic is interesting because it shows polls agreeing more on % for Trump, Rubio, Cruz than Bush or Kasich.

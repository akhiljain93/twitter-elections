So @greggutfeld, if Rubio repeating himself shows his youth and inexperience, does Trump repeating himself show his senility? #TheFive
@ESTribune #mockdebate Mr. Rubio, can you say anything about how Obama knows exactly what he's doing?
@justkarl that's why Rubio parried off the topic and went back to his.message. For all the flak, message discipline is important.

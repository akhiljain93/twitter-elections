@slone @jsamulowitz Rubio won bigger, liberal-leaning cities. Tells u something about him. For what that's worth.
@dansenor @sleepywizard @rushlimbaugh Then why did Rubio join with Schumer for amnesty? YUCK - ESTABLISHMENT!!

Marco Rubio: When I'm president we will have a "real war on terror." Terrorist will get a one way tix to Guantanamo. @NECN
Rubio always strikes me as a guy who just finished a Jordan Belfort seminar and is super excited to try his new tricks out on a crowd.
@AndreaTantaros @etphome70 They don't like Ted Cruz. They are going to endorse Rubio as soon as they are sure the fix is in.

A vote for Rubio is like a vote for Hillary. Rubio has NO chance against her. The man will get destroyed by her.
Yeah, all you who saw that, he was making a "Marco Polo" joke while I typed. Whoops. Trying again.

@gregorysdew patience while I sort a few things out this week. Want to write about Marco Rubio for us?
@LowCountryKat He better be worried about Rubio.He got caught in between two Cubans last night. What a sandwich. He's awfully quiet today
There's a reason Christie calls Rubio a "boy in the bubble". Attempts to purge people like @michellemalkin show the Rubes safe space needs.

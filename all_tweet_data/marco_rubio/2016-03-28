If anybody gets Rubio's delegates in La primary it should be the winner.(Trump) If not then those should be disallowed. Get it right GOPers
After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way anyone would endorse me!
@xo__madi__xo @Castle___Marco awe thanks
@realDonaldTrump rubio is a light weight anyways pussy couldnt handle it
@Neal_Dewing @joellemiller92 Not in 2016. But based on GOP choices we got now, Rubio's looking good for 2020. 
The Rubio ppl want a GOPe candidate. With brokered convention they can choose whoever they want. Romney, Ryan, Rubio..but not Trump or Cruz
How do people not realize how perfect Rubio is for the Timberwolves? If we got a different PG we would have to re work our entire offense.
@realDonaldTrump SUE,that's all u do. Marco's Louisiana delegate are unbound and can go to whichever candidate they want. They don't want u
Marco Torres Retweeted

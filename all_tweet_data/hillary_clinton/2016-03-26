@KyleKulinski I would have said it was just important for CNN to disclose how much their parent companies gave Hillary.

@ForPetesSake__ Hillary AND Bernie supporters are getting on my nerves
Bernie is a part-time proctologist.  He just kicked the sh*t out of Clinton in Washington (74-26) and Alaska (79-21).  Feel the Bern!

@Joe_America1776 @BlissTabitha The National Enquirer said Trump and Hillary did the tube steak boogie... I dunno, just what I heard...
Hilary Clinton stated that the United Stated would continue to provide Israel with the "most sophisticated defense technology."
Bernie now has 77% of Hillary's pledged delegate count. All the conservative states, which hillary wins, are done voting. #FeelTheBern

They ran out of new voter registration sheets in Hawaii. Good night Hillary.
Rotten corp media @CNN whose parent=huge Clinton donor KEEPS incl Super Delegates But #DNC said NOT to count! ACTUAL - HRC=1229 Sanders=951
Its interesting that Bernie 'crushed' Hillary w/ 72% reporting for 399 votes. Minor win and proves that caucuses don't bring voters out.
I think she will decide not to run for a second term. Hillary Clinton: One-term president? http://theweek.com/articles/566778/hillary-clinton-oneterm-president …

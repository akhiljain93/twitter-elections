Hope all the Hillary people are proud of putting in the first gentleman who is sex offender with a 12 year old on orgy island

Ppl talk about Sanders's policies being unrealistic but don't talk about how unrealistic it is that Clinton thinks she can work with the GOP
WTF hasn't anyone carried Granny Hillary to Vegas with them over the years, obviously she's a gambler's best friend. A human troll doll.

@Marv_Vien Hillary is a fighter, she never says die.  I love that about her
@milkvamp no, no, we lost because we lost.  this time.  400 votes behind isn't a huge victory for Hillary.  keep fighting!
#tytlive Hillary supporters already "got theirs" w/ their 401K's & investments - they don't G.A.S. abt younger ppl, that's obvious by now.
Bernie and Hillary can't blame problems on Republicans. OBAMA and Democrats had the reins for 7 yrs. Want change? #VoteTrump Trump2016

@ron_hazlett @VirginiaInCal Hey. She does lie and is inconsistent, but "whore" that's harsh. We aren't like some of the Hillary supporters!
I hit the TV remote "jump" button; the TV went from @CNN's #Hillary speech to "Web of Lies" on @DiscoveryID. #Irony #WebOfLies #NVcaucus
Clinton's *opening* policy platform, the thing that inevitably gets negotiated down, is "we can't do anything, now quit whining."

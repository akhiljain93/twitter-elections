Coming into the home stretch for the Clinton campaign. Won't finish April with enough votes, but it's getting close.
Would #Hillary garner the same support if she had gone back to #RKansas after they were evicted from #DC? She's just #MittRomney but in #NY.
My son had  a profound statement after hearing Clinton won NY.  Foodstamps for life.

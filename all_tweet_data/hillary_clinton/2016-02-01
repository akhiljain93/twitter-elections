@LaKappaLyfe good predictions, BTW. Clinton-Sanders probably a wash for delegates, but big for her to be #1
I don't even live in Iowa and the caucus system is making me stressed as hell. Hillary and Bernie's twitters are #lit encouraging turnout.
I will forever associate Hillary Clinton with Regina George now
I'm gonna be in a foul,dirty and nasty mood if Hillary wins so even you pro-Clinton folks better hope Bernie wins... #DoItForMe :)
A one vote victory is a HUGE win for Sanders. A thousand vote win for Clinton helps her a lot. O'Malley wins big if he gets more than 5%.

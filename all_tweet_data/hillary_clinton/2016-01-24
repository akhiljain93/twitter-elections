@a11Igot @spiritmoon7 we believe Hillary is that person. Bernie honestly had 30 years to effect change & didn't.

Is Trump cracking up? Republicans must play fair & get him some help asap.   Women don't crack. Hillary is trailblazing comfortably!
I'm happy #Hillary has the endorsement of @DMRegister...but it's kinda sexist to ask her to apologize..George W was never asked to apologize
@ChrisLoesch @TheRight4332 Trump can't beat Hillary.   There isn't any national poll that says that.  You're delusional.

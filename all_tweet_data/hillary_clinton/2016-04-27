If you remove Hillary's superdelegate totals, which don't officially count until July, she cannot win until June. Even that's tough.
Even if you count Hillary's pledged superdelegates, which you should not do until the convention, she cannot win in April or May. Impossible
"Terror-hating Muslim Americans", yup that's what Hillary has boiled us down to. Justice loving, health care for all seeking Muslims, nah.

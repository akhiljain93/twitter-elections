"I'm a feminist because I believe women deserve the same rights as men." —Hillary #MSNBCTownhall
Clinton's response when asked whether she considers herself a feminist: http://nbcnews.to/1VyJDJl 
Clinton tonight on MSNBC: "I am going to have a cabinet that looks like America, and 50 percent of America is women, right?”

When asked about feminism, Clinton unable cite a specific policy she has that will help women. More platitudes. #DemTownHall

"As a white person, I have to talk about [racism] more. We are not a post-racial society." —Hillary to @Maddow #MSNBCTownhall
TBH I don't remember at end of 2008 primary too many people arguing then-Sen Obama had to move to Hillary's positions to woo her supporters1

I like how Hillary says "healthcare & education" are strong points for her campaign when she doesn't want those things to be universal.
Good for #Hillary calling out @maddow BS "if you are ahead": "Rachel, I AM ahead by 2.7 million votes and over 250 pledged delegates"!
Clinton to @maddow: 'I did not put down conditions' before supporting Obama in 2008 http://nbcnews.to/1SKmWBr pic.twitter.com/ah8ISw1HQ8
Shame on Rachel Maddow for suggesting Hillary isn't ahead of Bernie in popular vote. Go HRC for setting her straight #MSNBCtownhall
Clinton: In '08 40% of her supporters said they wouldn't support Obama. She worked hard to help, she nominated him. "That's what one does."
Clinton: "I have 2.7 million more votes than [Sanders] has .... I AM ahead."  #Decision2016
Hillary is done with @maddow's bias. Maddow: if you're ahead in the vote. Hillary: I AM AHEAD RACHEL! #love

Hillary always says you need to propose solutions not just diagnose the problems, as if Bernie hasn't given more policy substance than her.

Sanders' message is clear: he'd do all he can to stop the GOP but his voters won't easily be convinced to vote Clinton, that that's on her.

Thank you Bernie for basically saying you won't tell people to vote for Hillary if she wins the nomination! I won't! #DemTownHall
Hillary is the antithesis of #BernieSanders. She will never get my vote.  #DemTownHall
Sanders just declined to say that his supporters should back Hillary in November if she wins the nomination. That's...pretty bad.
Excellent, Bernie! It's on Hillary to attract Bernie voters! #NoFreeVotes #DemTownHall
6 predictions call tomorrow's primaries for Trump and Clinton http://bloom.bg/1SHohcf pic.twitter.com/S65b9QxvFi
Here's the news - Sanders won't urge supporters to vote for Clinton. and this is important news.
Asked if he would encourage his backers to support Clinton, Sanders says "if we end up losing … it is incumbent upon her" to make the case.
Asked if he'd back Clinton if she wins, Sanders says on MSNBC town hall he can't "snap my fingers" & turn voters to her bc they won't listen
All that $$ Clinton is raising for DNC/state parties will help nominee in the general — even Bernie Sanders. http://wapo.st/1VVOuTL 
I think these questions about whether Bernie will support Hillary are absolutely absurd! Newsflash: The primary is not over! #MSNBCtownhall
Hey! I'm one of those young voters. Yeah...I'm not voting for Hillary. #Inners

If Republicans are such a minority and have no chance against Hillary and the Democrats, why do we have a Republican House and Senate?

@Brad_Hope You think Hillary is "likeable"? @gaetzy93
Clinton & Brock keep sending the paid #hillbots. Shows they've done the math & know we can still win this. #EndCyBernBullying #StillSanders
BernieBros: Sanders has the will of the people BernieBros: Well Sanders won more counties so he should've won even if Hillary had more votes

@prolific_prose @BobbyTBD Agree. $12 an hour goes further in Iowa (where I live) than $15 an hour does in NYC. That's Hillary's point.

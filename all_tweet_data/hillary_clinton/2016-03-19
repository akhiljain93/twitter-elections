That's why those Clinton numbers are so great! You can get, not just a majority, but a COMMANDING majority, pretty much without white guys.
Can you imagine the hysteria in the media if trump supporters blocked people from seeing Hillary or Bernie? #ImNotEvenATrumpGuy

@JayCostTWS @jetx86 Right. Actually, I would think conservatives would be most comfortable with Clinton in the Situation Room.

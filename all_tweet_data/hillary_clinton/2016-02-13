Let me remind you all that it was a Clinton who nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
If I was Obama, and I just wanted to watch the world burn, I'd nominate Hillary for supreme court. Everyone's head would explode.
@jaketapper No Problem. President Bernie Sanders or President Hillary Clinton can then nominate President Obama to the Supreme Court. @cnn
@DouthatNYT  Tough to imagine Dems getting more moderate than that, of course, and Reps can always confirm if they see Hillary likely to win
@nytimes Yep, Hillary can appoint Obama!
.@LisaBloom @4lisaguerrero  I also don't have a problem with President Hillary Clinton making the nomination. That'll work.
If the GOP want to delay appointment until Clinton is president that's fine by me. Supreme Court Justice @BarackObama has a nice ring to it.

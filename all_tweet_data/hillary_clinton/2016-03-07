#DemTownHall now hillary is using ted cruz talking points "competition" cant get us to universal health care
Clinton: "Blue Cross used to be non-profits," now they're for-profits. She wants "more non-profits to fill this space."
@greenBASEDpack Clinton and Sanders?

The most important thing we learned from Hillary Clinton and the FBI http://knowtechie.com/important-thing-learned-hillary-fbi/ … via @MarcusTJensen
@BretBaier Prior to ObamaCare 88 percent of Americans had health insurance. Eight years of ObamaCare had added 2 percent if Clinton is right
Does Hillary realize that most of the #Obamacare non-profit co-ops went bankrupt? Someone should tell her. #DemTownHall

Crime challenges?, Crime epidemic? Hillary, Hillary.... only in Democratic run cities..
@TheYoungTurks Only Hillary, queen of parsing, could try to make the "free" vs "debt-free" distinction relevant. #DemTownHall #tytlive
Hillary's "debt free college" plan makes no sense. Even after she explained it, it still makes zero sense. #DemTownHall

Hillary is talking free tuition. She made it impossible to get rid of student loans by taking bankruptcy. Taxes & student loans r exempt
@VABVOX Just keep your head held high. You are helping so many understand the issues and be intelligent in their support of Hillary.
Clinton's reasoning for Libya action are identical to the reasoning for Iraq war. #FoxTownHall
Clinton just said she and Sanders share the goal of "universal coverage," a continued distortion. Coverage =/= care.

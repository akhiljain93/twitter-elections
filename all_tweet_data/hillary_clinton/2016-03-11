Hillary's Reagan/AIDS absurdity + last debate shows what kind of president she'd be: Redbait the Left, pander to the Right. Ah, Clintonism!

sad to see so many people supporting Hillary purely for the fact she's a female without taking into consideration her political stances
If BS gets enough kids that have never worked 2 VOTE, he might beat Clinton. Younger & more naive they are, the better chance he has. #Trump

Neither #NancyReagan or Ronnie's wikipedia pages mention #AIDS at all. No wonder #Hillary couldn't fact check.
@cnnbrk Much ado about nothing. Hillary will only increase her delegate lead with wins in FL and NC. #Hillary2016
I can’t believe I’m actually saying this, but I think Obama or Hillary would select a better option fro SCOTUS than Trump would.
So when will Hillary praise Strom Thurmond and George Wallace for starting "a national conversation" on segregation & civil rights?

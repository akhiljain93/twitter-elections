More people need to realize they're actually better off with Trump than Hillary and this isn't a troll tweet.
It's so classic that in Trump's greatest win (finally over 50%!) in home state, it appears he lost to Kasich in Manhattan! #NoPoorlyEducated
Donald Trump is on track to win the #NYPrimary by more than 50% http://cnn.it/NYPrimary  #PrimaryDayhttp://cnn.it/1SjxH8j 
Current guesstimates- if everything stays as is, Trump wins 92 delegates out of 95.
Going forward, polls show John Kasich is consistently the best candidate to take on Trump. 2nd in CT, MD, NJ. And 2nd tonight in NY.
Manafort tells reporters Trump isn't trying to change the rules now but in the future when he calls out the "rigged system"

At the moment, Trump would win 92 of the 95 delegates statewide (if AP count is accurate)

I like that @MonicaCrowley is pointing out that Trump is playing up the victim mentality with his supporters. It's a progressive tactic.
Now the "Well Trump didn't cuss tonight-he's way more presidential now" portion of this debacle   May we all have such low bars to jump over
Trump got more than 80% of the vote on Staten Island. Sweet mercy, folks.
@seanhannity so disappointed in you.. Used to think you're a conservative.. You're nothing but a shill for trump... And a Cruz hater.. Smh

…and people wonder who is voting for Trump. 
If you're Trump winning NY is not enough. Hitting 50% statewide is not enough. You need 95 dels, period. Disregard coverage to the contrary.

Trump will get under 60% of the vote but more than 90% of the delegates in NY.  By his definition, that's unfair and "rigged"
#Trump at 80% in Staten Island with almost 20% in - we are not in Wisconsin anymore @AlexisinNH @_HankRearden
Closest breakdown is rural upstate with Trump 46, Kasich 33. 26% of the state, and under 50%. Signals loss of 5 delegates.
Trump won NY and he called 9/11 7/11..... it's a sad day to be a New Yorker

Cruz is saying Trump's Campaign admitted he was not going to do anything he promised to the RNC!  This is a COMPLETE LIE! Cruz is scum.
It's ironic.  Everyone has been saying, "Trump needs to be more presidential!"    So when he tells the RNC he will be, everyone freaks.
Folks, this "Trump is a phony" meme from the Cruz Camp is a joke.  Manafort merely said Trump would be more presidential going forward.

#Cruz’s Texas primary win was marked as the lowest home state support in 104 years. 43.8%. Still, #Trump captured 30% of delegates, not “0”.
..yes, #Cruz won TX 43.8%..  #Trump won NY 60%  ..Trump left TX with 30% of that states delegates.. Cruz left NY with nothing, as in ‘zero'.

The reason Trump won't debate @tedcruz is not because of his fear of debate, it's because he knows Cruz will expose his liberalism too soon.

I think Trump could probably change everything about himself & his policies & still keep his supporters except maybe his name. It’s a thing.

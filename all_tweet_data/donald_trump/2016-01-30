But this idiot high school kid stood across the street with a Trump sign making a fool of himself. There's a reason people are booing you.
And Register poll finds Cruz up with regular caucus goers, Trump up with new ones. Reinforces unpredictable nature of a turnout race.

Despite the DMR poll w/ Trump ahead it's really just a jump ball in Iowa. I'd actually be more surprised if Cruz doesn't win.

Evangelicals are key, per DMR poll, which counted 47% of likely caucusgoers as evangelicals. But if 60% show up, it's Trump 26%-Cruz 25%

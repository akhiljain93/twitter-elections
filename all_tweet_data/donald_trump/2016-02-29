Trump ends speech after 38 minutes. No attacks on Rubio other than calling him "little lightweight."
No one Trump should have all that power.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/DnpO_RTSNmQ?a  Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Donald Trump (HBO)
A protest at a Trump rally is news.Guess the agent feels he works for The Donald instead of  taxpayers who fund salary.

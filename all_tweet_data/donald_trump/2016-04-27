Trump's Foreign Policy Speech - nothing short of remarkable.  It is honestly hard to imagine anyone seriously contradicting it's clarity.
Tremendous speech by Trump on foreign policy.  he grows better and better each day
Summary of Trump foreign policy speech "My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security first."
Elites have to attack Trump's foreign policy speech because he is challenging their core values and failures. To them it is dangerous ideas.
This was a serious foreign policy speech by Trump. It is worth reading and thinking about. It will be ridiculed by Washington elites.
TRUMP TO NEOCONS: "Geeeeeeeeet 'em outta here. OUT! OUT! OUT!"
Trump demonstrated he is not a realist on foreign policy but is instead a fantasist.  His ideas were all in the vein of magical thinking.

TRUMP: "We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism."

What we've learned today abt life thru Nov if Trump wins:some reporters can't be objective abt him & left/right critics will sound the same
Donald Trump: “'America first' will be the major and overriding theme of my administration”  http://cnn.it/1NzjxmX http://cnn.it/1VCwor9 
With prescient timing we have come to expect, Lyin' Ted will now beat the 'women hate Trump' drum. A day after women chose Trump in the NE.
Final thought on Trump's foreign policy speech -- Ronald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave.
#TRUMP. World on notice- new sheriff in town. USA no longer run by idiots, incompetents, pathetic liberal fools, or those that hate us.
Trump said nobody can explain Obama's foreign policy? I did a couple months ago in 18 tweets.  https://storify.com/matungawalla/mike-grunwald …
Trump says he wants to work "very closely with our allies in the Muslim world". And saying "Islam hates us" and "ban Muslims" will do that?

.@realDonaldTrump on his foreign policy: The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemieshttp://nbcnews.to/1rihJop 
So we know just as much about Trump's foreign policy now as we did before the speech.
Ann Coulter Retweeted Diana West
Trump: No American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the needs of a citizen of a foreign country
.@PressSec opens WH briefing with a jab at ongoing Trump speech: "Apparently the phonetics were not included on the teleprompter."
Trump:  We will no longer surrender this country or it's people into the false song of globalism.
TRUMP: We will never enter any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.
Trump: "If I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me." http://abcn.ws/1TwRuDG http://snpy.tv/1qUiraQ 
WATCH: U.S. allies not paying their fair share of security burden, says Trump. http://reut.rs/1NTNed9 http://snpy.tv/26uBaKX 
TRUMP: AMERICANS WONDER WHY ARE POLITICIANS MORE INTERESTED IN PROTECTING BORDERS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAN STRENGTHENING OUR OWN.
Our analysis: Not only did Trump hit this one out of the park, but he did so while the bases were loaded- grand slam. This ensures 1,237.
Trump lies about being against Iraq again.   Quick history lesson: advocated for it at length in 2000 book. Said he supported in 2002...
Trump is contending that the Obama administration is too timid, but too muscular, too. He'll be the same, but different.
Trump's speech is just a drawn out version of: "We will win so much, and be so strong, believe me"
Trump has set the bar so low that he actually sounds presidential, just by virtue of the fact that he's using a teleprompter.
After saying we need to be more "unpredictable," Trump says the secret to successful foreign policy is consistency.
Question #1 for Trump: Are we sure the guy running the teleprompter has the pages in the right order? #notmakinganysense
Trump foreign policy: If we fight, we need to win. Got it! [checks box]
Donald Trump: "We must develop a foreign policy based on American interests" http://cnn.it/1NzjxmX http://cnn.it/1QATM07 
Teleprompter Trump sounds like an ill prepared 8th grader faking his way through an oral report. #TanZanya
Donald Trump: "ISIS will be gone if I'm elected president, and they’ll be gone quickly" http://cnn.it/1NzjxmX http://cnn.it/1NTKBYM 
.@realDonaldTrump on ISIS: "Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how"http://snpy.tv/1QATuGy 
Tan-zane-ia, Trump says, apparently confusing African country with Tasmania. But that devil is an awful dictator.
This speech shows Trump is growing as a candidate. It will help him a lot.

WATCH: U.S. foreign policy a 'complete and total disaster': Trump. http://reut.rs/1SKq7pF http://snpy.tv/1rif7H8 
Not sure who is advising Trump on foreign policy but I can understand why he’s not revealing their names.
I was just on CNN discussing #DonaldTrump's foreign policy: http://cnn.it/1NTJsR2  I'll also be offering reaction right after his speech
WATCH: @realDonaldTrump criticizes @HillaryClinton during speech: "It was a total lie" http://cbsn.ws/21vPMY2 http://snpy.tv/1NTKegO 
TRUMP: WE MUST STOP IMPORTING EXTREMISM THROUGH IMMIGRATION POLICIES
Trump is helping himself a lot with this speech.  It will resonate well with a lot of traditional peace through strength Republicans.
Trump: We need a new foreign policy, but I have no intention of laying out what that would be now or ever
If Bush 43 or @MittRomney had given this Trump speech as prez candidates, it would be hailed as good politics & interesting worldview
Legacy of Obama interventions will be "weakness, confusion and disarray," Trump says: http://cbsn.ws/21vPMY2 http://snpy.tv/26uxoRz 
I never thought the day would come when someone would give the speech Trump is giving right now.  GO TRUMP!
When he's done, would love to see Trump take a brief quiz on the contents of the speech he's reading.

To say this Trump foreign policy speech is light on specifics is an insult to specifics.
Trump a migraine-inducing simpleton & his FP ideas little more than slogans he focus-grouped in his head while sitting on porcelain throne.
Donald Trump is delivering a major foreign policy speech in Washington. Watch live: http://cnn.com/go http://cnn.it/1ricLrz

.@POTUS has weakened the U.S. military by weakening our economy, @realDonaldTrump says: http://cbsn.ws/21vPMY2 http://snpy.tv/1VCrnyE 
Biggest mistake those who consistently misunderstand Trump will make abt this speech: failure to see he passionately believes every word
This speech is making Trump seem school-board-presidential.
TRUMP: We're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own.
Everything that Trump says when he's not insulting people is an overused cliche already uttered by every politician in American history
Donald Trump says his foreign policy "replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy and chaos with peace" http://cnn.it/1SswW0i 
Trump: Our foreign policy has had no vision no purpose no strategy.

@realDonaldTrump @KatrinaPierson Trump is clueless and so are you! Get a grip lady! You make yourself look foolish on tv. #nevertrump
Trump is a bully who surrounds himself w bullies. If I lived in Collins's NYork district, I'd voice my displeasure  http://ln.is/huffingtonpost.com/niZ3D …
I disagree with Trump on Heidi Cruz (beautiful in person), but I'll concede to him that Melania's the best looking wife he's ever purchased.
Dunno. Would rather read something like this from a female journalist. Trump the loser http://thehill.com/opinion/brent-budowsky/274102-brent-budowsky-trump-the-loser#.VvR-g84diIg.twitter …
@Adam4004 @jamesplake721 Trump does NOT "have" a strip club. Its the branding of the casino, nothing to do with it.
Abolishing NATO is beyond absurd #Trump

I can't tell if people are voting for Donald trump as a joke or..
Remember when Trump's doctor said he would be "the healthiest individual ever elected president"?
If you have to constantly argue and defend trump that he isn't racist...he's racist

@reillyadam @michaelpfreeman Don't want Hillary, but would never vote Trump or Cruz!!
@MikeBloomberg its time to do something to stop Trump.  We need someone with your level of media influence to do it.  Are you in?
Will you support Donald Trump if he wins the Republican nomination? YES. What do you think? http://www.conservativeoutfitters.com/blogs/news/88968257-poll-will-you-support-trump-if-he-wins-the-nomination … via @ConsrvOutfitter
@TheVoiceOfPaulR @Drudge_Report_ No we need patience. Grasshopper. 70% overwhelming turnout did not vote 4 Trump. Ergo. 2 man race he loses.
According to Gallop polls, 90% of people want our southern border controlled. So don't give me this crap about Trump being racist.

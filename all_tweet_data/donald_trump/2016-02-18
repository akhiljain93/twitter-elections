@Conservative_VW Well I do not want to critique the Pope at all. But I can think of a lot of world leaders to condemn other than Trump.

the main dude for my religion doesn't support trump's actions that should be a good enough excuse
I have a feeling that there are millions upon millions of Christians in the U.S. that want a wall regardless of what the Pope or Trump says.
I'm praying that @CNN plants the Pope in the audience tonight to ask Trump a question.
I wouldn't compare Donald Trump to Melchizedek, Trump is  more like Nehemiah who sought to build a wall around God's people.

@ImDanielDennehy when trump gets elected you know where to run and hide
@MyDaughtersArmy So #Trump has no long term memory?  That's a quality you want in a POTUS.
"If Isis attacks the Vatican, the pope will have wished and prayed that trump was president" trump str8 threw shade at the pope
@BenHatch If Trump becomes POTUS, is this how he is going to behave towards the leader of any country that criticises the US?
The Pope has shot his mouth off about Gun Control, Global Warming, and Donald Trump.  Now it's my turn.  Shut Up Francis!

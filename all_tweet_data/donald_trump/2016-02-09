Whatever one thinks of Donald Trump's policies, a primary victory here, by any margin, would be a huge tsunami. Undeniable.
If it ends up being Sanders vs. Trump, forget Bloomberg. @smod2016 and cthulhu will be viable candidates.
There is nothing "conservative" about Trump. Perhaps that's because there's so little left to conserve. Blame the GOP, not The Donald.

Bernie will stomp Hillary. Trump will win barely. Rubio will nip at Trump's heels. Kasich/Bush surges are a myth. Christie, Carson drop out.

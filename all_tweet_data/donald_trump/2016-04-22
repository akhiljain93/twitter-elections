Trump's Spokesperson said "Trump will change his personality to appeal more to women and minorities for the General election."Said out loud?
So if all the current numbers hold in upcoming GOP primaries, Trump will easily hit 1237.  Something has to change for him not to hit target
People say Trump won't appeal to women but Mickey Rooney got married eight times, so who knows?

John Kasich thinks @BernieSanders has no shot at winning the presidency. He should probably brush up on his pollshttp://on.nowth.is/nra 
My guys, 1 & 2, are Cruz, Trump. It's going to be one or the other. Jebbie, go home; Christie, eat at Subway; Kasich, just go hide.

@Yipicya @tedcruz Trump won the debate. No doubt. Rand actually beat RINO's Jeb and Kasich in the latest poll. That's why he protested.

@Bipolarsmom2 @MissMandi00 @Waterboarding3 Hillary punches her sentences in a simpleton manner, and Kasich is a karate chopping freak.
@HillaryClinton @SenSanders @GOP  Except for Kasich, all GOP candidates are peddlers of fear. Vote Democrat if you want hope + optimism.
@Women4Trump @twh318 @ark54301 I can't stand Kasich or Paul, Think Carson is a good man. Bush is a lightweight. No to Christie.

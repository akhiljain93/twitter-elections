#TedCruz  is now telling #NewYorkers #Kasich will not be on the ballot. #PantsOnFire #Cruz has a real problem with finding the truth #Liar
#TrumpSuperPowers to keep Kasich, Bush or Rubio from winning a GOP nomination when they are clearly more qualified, principled and sane.
We could have a daily substantive debate featuring Marco Rubio.   Instead, John Kasich.

@BretBaier You've been fair to Cruz! EXCEPT that Cruz beats Hillary in most polls. You make it sound as though only kasich does.

Spent some time on the bus with John Kasich today. He talks endorsements on @WISN12News at 6pm.pic.twitter.com/VPFHLAAGMb
The media says only Kasich can beat Hillary! This is pure propaganda! I just can't wrap my head around why their is so much lying from media
Hey Kasich! Only a megalomaniac would back-stab a prez candidate CLEARLY CHOSEN BY THE PPL! GET IT, IT WASN'T YOU!! pic.twitter.com/Xq70tghLDs
Poll: Donald Trump Beats Both Cruz and Kasich Soundly in Head-to-Head Contests: At what point is… http://m.tbnn.it/Ksdm4w  | @gatewaypundit
Trump would b well advised to invite 3rd place runner John Kasich to join his team as Vice President if he is elected? Cruz could do same?
Now why would George Soros give money to Kasich? I know he only gives money to his puppets
Fox,Bloomberg,Quinnipiac,CNN,CBS/NYT polls,each + every one, show John Kasich the only GOP candidate who beats http://HRC-The.Only.One .

John Kasich says he's not looking for VP, but that is exactly what he's doing! He just might wind up getting it from either Trump or Cruz

@Browncoat_Atty @PolitiBunny Fox just did a new poll, Kasich beats Hillary by 10%, Cruz by 3% and Trump gets his ass handed to him
Jim Shellenberger Retweeted Fox News
Given the choice of Biden or kasich for Vp, I choose Biden. At least he is amusing.
Truthfully, I want Trump to win without Ohio to dispel that political myth Kasich is peddling.  #specialreport
I'd suggest Kasich voters unite with Cruz voters, but I've never actually met one. #KasichUgh
@CLewandowski_ @politico Time for kasich and cruz to drop out and unite the party behind Donald Trump! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Hahahaha! @FoxNews sending me updates to tune in on release of new Cruz or Kasich vs Hillary poll. Hahahahahahaha! No eff'n way I'm done.

@ScottBLG @JohnKasich @glennbeck ...the only way Kasich  has a chance, is if you use common core math
I would lose a little respect for #Cruz2016 if he selected Kasich for VP.  They don't share same Principles.
FOX NEWS POLL looks shady to me....just do not see how that can be!! #Kasich beating #Trump???!! NO WAY!!

my my Fox trying to manipulate the numbers again in saying Kasich is the favorite of the people! if that is so Y  are his numbers the lowest
Explain to me how I'm supposed to believe the anti-Trump polls when he turns out 10s of thousands and Kasich can't fill a closet. I call BS.

18 of the last 26 states are winner-take-all, rather than proportional, so if 2 of Rubio-Cruz-Kasich drop out soon, one of them can win.
Mom said she voted for Trump because she couldn't remember where Kasich was from...

Voted. No lines. Not crowded. Number 532 on the ballot machine in a big polling area. Only Kasich supporter handing out stuff #SuperTuesday
if i could mix aspects of kasich, bush, sanders & clinton, i'd have the perfect presidential candidate. 
@Nbruns6 I have looked at kasich but considering what he has done to our education system
#SuperTuesday  Vermont Projections- Winner: Donald Trump Second: Marco Rubio Third: Ted Cruz Fourth: Ben Carson Fifth: John Kasich
My conservative guess for #SuperTuesday tonight is Bernie Sanders wins 3-4 states, John Kasich wins 1 & Cruz wins 3. Hope they outperform.
Last RCP poll averages in Virginia: Trump 37, Rubio 22, Cruz 18 Kasich, Carson 7; Clinton 56, Sanders 35. Just saying

My #SuperTuesday prediction: Trump and Hillary rule, Carson and Kasich drool. Rubio, Cruz limping along. Bernie fighting the good fight
@AmDeazy i just really dont want this to be a clinton vs trump election.. Its a shame that Kasich doesnt get the recognition he deserves
Where the candidates will be tonight: Trump, Clinton, Rubio (FL), Sanders (VT), Kasich (MS) , Carson (MD), Cruz (TX)
Hoping every single "I voted sticker" is NOT for Bernie, hil(liar)y, kasich, Carson, Cruz, and definitely not trump sooo only 1 person left

@DYC_ReBeL probably Kasich
I predict that Kasich will win every state
Rubio needs to promise Cruz a spot in SCOTUS if he drops, pick Kasich as a VP, and go for Trumps throat. Only way the Republicans will win.

@noyam It is. But, he is stronger than Kasich on some points (like Israel), so let's look to the positive. He's my horse now, back him 100%
Trump was under Kasich on the ballot so was Huckabee and Rand and all other dropouts.
@CBSNews @JohnKasich Kasich's game plan at this point is probably to wait for his party to implode when they refuse to nominate Trump.

What Ben Carson and John Kasich can do however at this point is to endorse a candidate of their choosing. Its a 3 man race in the GOP field.
I can't express this enough- Carson and Kasich need to drop their bids and let the people flock to those who actually have a chance.
@realDonaldTrump Campaign Strategy - Mention Dr. Carson and Gov Kasich in every response. Never mention the other 2. You will control debate
I think it's time Ben Carson and John Kasich pull out of the race. There's no point in staying on a losing battle.

i would love if everybody dropped out and put their support behind kasich but that's just wishful thinking
Kasich is asking Marco to drop out! Lol http://fb.me/7RWaUDiGa 
GOP should push for 2-person race w/ Trump & Rubio. Kasich loses Ohio, drops out. Cruz drops out week after #SuperTuesday. Carson=Irrelevant
Well I voted for Kasich. Something about that Ohio connection. At least my Mother would be proud.  @EBOlady @ChrisJansing @KristinDonnelly
I hope Kasich wins republican nominee.

@smats88 @mckaycoppins If Kasich did that, I would lose all respect for him. Only justification would be that he truly wants to make a diff.
@PatrickRuffini @iSideWith If their data were correct, by end of tonight it’d be: Trump 301, Rubio 289, Cruz 129, Carson 64, Kasich. Nah.

At Super Tuesday rally, Kasich urges patience, pivots north http://usat.ly/1oWBiSl  via @usatoday
Funny thing is I honestly believe someone like Kasich would've swept the floor with Hillary.
Just met a voter in Henrico who said he was split between Hillary and Kasich. He went Hillary because Kasich is "the forgotten guy"
Republican Predictions overall: Trump, Rubio, Cruz, Kasich, Carson. Cruz victory in Texas. 12-30 leads for Trump elsewhere. #Election2016.

So after Trump wins all the primaries today will we stop reading about John Kasich's strategy to win a brokered convention?

#Carson was in a blank void. Then he saw #Kasich.  "Where are we?" he asked.  "The place candidates go when people stop believing in them."
If Carson and Kasich would have dropped out last week, things might look better in stopping the Trump Train.
@dick_nixon If he loses winner-take-all Florida on the 15th - especially if Kasich wins Ohio on the same day - I can't see him staying in.

For the 1st time we're going to see real consequences of Kasich/Carson in the race, especially in 20/15% thresholds.They'll pull 10% or more

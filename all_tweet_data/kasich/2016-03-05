If #Rubio cannot win Florida, and Kasich does WIN OHIO...It's game over. Give your delagtes to either Kasich or Cruz.
What a swing... Recent Kansas polls: Trump 35, Cruz 29, Rubio 17, Kasich 13.  Results from Kansas: Cruz 51, Trump 24, Rubio 14, Kasich 9.
.@CNN still ignoring Kasich in favor of more Rubio coverage. 
Saw John Kasich say he's with Harry Potter and not going to the Dark Side. I guess he won't get the geek vote mixing franchises like that

Rubio has to win in Florida, or he is gone. My sense is that after March 15th it will be Trump, Cruz, and Kasich.
Cruz, Rubio, and Kasich are smart to stay in GOP race to split delegates against Drumpf. That's main reason why they're in. #SuperSaturday

@Nate_Cohn @kkondik  CT, NY and RI, voting in April, are proportional.  Kasich may do very well if he stays in.
Strategic voting is indeed a thing. It's why Trump's dreaded 2 way could happen despite Kasich or Rubio, and Cruz can play in blue states.
I think Kasich should drop out and back Cruz...Picturing them as possibly winning the Presidency wouldn't make me pull my hair out.
If you thought Kasich an alternative, his bite of the day: "Just like Harry Potter, I won't turn to the dark side." May the force find him.

What kind of a person is Kasich & Rubio to want this to go to convention where neither of them will win ? Are their egos that selfish?
@marcorubio drop out so Kasich and Cruz can get your delegates, if u lose Florida to Trump your political career will be cemented as loser

No matter your opinion of him, Ted Cruz earned the right to stay in 'til the end. Rubio and Kasich are now "spoilers" 'til proven otherwise.
@SWBurbs @redhairedwonder @jaketapper I'll be stunned if Rubio doesn't win FL.  I'm more worried about Kasich winning OH.

@AviWoolf Kasich is in MI - Never went to KS - Rubio did. Hows that working out? Better take Cruz up on the Veep thing soon.
@NateSilver538 And Kasich is delusional. Not sure what OH win even means for him at this pt. Where's win #2?

I need Kasich to win a bunch of large Midwestern states. I deserve to see one brokered convention in my lifetime.
I really thought after #GOPDebate that #Kasich would dominate today. Shame on #Trump #Cruz #Rubio supporters. Is #GOP over? #SuperSaturday
I'm very displeased with Cruz/Kasich as they refuse to hit Bully Donald for his continued ignorance and hatred. Be a leader, not a coward.
@earthexperience @rsummers16 @KatyinIndy Yep. Rubio hasn't said he'd drop out, but it's widely assumed. Kasich said he definitely would
Cruz is winning Kansas in a blowout. Cruz 51% Trump 24% Rubio 14% Kasich 9%

Ted Cruz? He's competent enough, but dangerous. Trump is clearly incompetent enough to be dangerous! Get real republicans - Kasich!

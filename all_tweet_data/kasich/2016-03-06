http://ow.ly/Z8rX6  Rubio & Kasich far more downside in home states than upside.  Time to walk away. VP candidate has to win home state.

Rubio can't win Ohio & Kasich can't win Florida. Each winning their own states not very likely but much likelier than one winning both.
At first I thought Cruz might make a good vp but so much dishonesty surrounds him. Thinking either Carson or Kasich now.

@Dizzy329 @BProhodski I can talk about it because Kasich is my Govenor and has betrayed this state. Not sure why you think Trump is shady..
wouldn't be surprised if cruz and kasich have side deal to keep kasich in race, thus marginalizing rubio

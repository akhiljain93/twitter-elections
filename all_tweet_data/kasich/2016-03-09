.@jbarro @TheStalwart @chrislhayes I think Acela & West Coast states have sizable #NeverCruz factions. Kasich gives them a non-Trump option.
@FoxNews @tedcruz Gee Ted's message sounds very much like Iowa Carson has dropped out come join our team Rubio Kasich supp Join our team

The GOP can't #StopTrump. Cruz can't.  Rubio can't. Kasich can't. The only person who can is @BernieSanders.  That's a fucking fact.

Everyone seems to assume Kasich is in the #NeverTrump camp. He never said that. Trump/Kasich is also possible. Powerful ticket #CNNsitroom

CNN discussing Rubio & Kasich will probably be encouraged to stay in race, even if they lose FL & OH, to try to rob votes from TRUMP.

Latest Rumor: Brokered GOP convention ends with a deal where Kasich and Rubio delegates get tossed to Cruz (1/2)
@mjdix8 @EZFballRankings @ByronYork he is just as qualified as Ted Cruz and perhaps more so than Donald Trump. More charisma than Kasich.
@mitchellvii As long as Kasich and Rubio stay in through the 15th I'd be happy.

So Trump could spend the debate beating up Kasich all night long, something that's not happened at all yet

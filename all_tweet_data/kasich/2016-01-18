Would consider Kasich, but I'm a temp chair for Dems.
The Republicans have 3 candidates who would have a serious chance at winning the general. Rubio, Kasich, Christie. In that order. That's it.
There's a huge similarity between how middle-left (Clinton) and middle-right (Bush, Kasich, Christie) in how they race.
NEW HAMPSHIRE   New Hampshire Polling Averages (by RealClearPolitics)  TRUMP 30.4% Rubio 14.2% Kasich 11.2% Cruz 11% Christie 9.2% Bush 8.4%
The only poll John Kasich is winning is twitter followers over Martin O'Malley. They are at the bottom of that list. #DemDebate #GOPDebate
Kasich is low in the polls because he's half-reasonable. Or, in a way the GOP can understand: HE'S WEAK. HE'S A LOSER. HE'S A DUMMY.
"Why's Kasich low in polls?"  He's the most reasonable & the base doesn't like that  "No GOP wants a compliment from 'genderfluid' atheists"

@_metafizik @Monsieur_Hank kasich is not what our country needs
Hopefully Ben Carson's supporters at least bring their votes to John Kasich. #NeverTrump #CruzSucksToo #LOLRubio
Trump is only marginally less imperialist than the likes of Cruz, Rubio and Kasich. He's still an imperialist.
Not really a conservative but I don't mind John Kasich's policies I mean at least he has them
@Markos_Anderson @asymmetricinfo Rubio has helped them more than anyone since he has served as the attack dog. Kasich plays footsies with DT
@JoePro2015 @BNONews gonna have to change my vote to Kasich
What is Kasich getting out of this? He has no chance & is only ruining other's.
John Kasich said he plans to win the Ohio primary and then the convention floor: ... Kasich more... http://bit.ly/21OqeV0  #NewHampshire
@WFlavin703 @taylor_tlb kasich, I think rand would've been a good candidate too but he didn't have enough GOP support

@WFlavin703 @collin_lcl Yea Kasich said he didn't even want to fight the courts on gay marriage.
Carson says "leave the rules as they are." FWIW, current 8-state rule could prevent Rubio/Cruz/Kasich from even being eligible to get votes.
Cruz, Rubio and Kasich are career politicians. The ONLY outsider is @realDonaldTrump
Kasich May Have Cut Off Rubio's Path To The Nomination http://53eig.ht/1OVlhAB 
If I was Kasich last night, I would have said "This shit is embarrassing, these assholes are clowns", kicked the podium over and walked out.

At least Carson dropped out because he didn't have a chance anymore. I wish Kasich would come to that realization.
@moiraforbes @PamEngel12 .  With exception of Kasich, @GOP candidates lack dignity that a head of state must have,  awful debate
Ben Carson just suspended his campaign. Your turn, Kasich.

@MaxGrossfeld don't count out Bush, Kasich or Christie until NH is over. They are not likely but if either beat Cruz or Rubio, it's on
@EdMorrissey Agree Ed.  Thinking Rubio though as Kasich hasn't a chance in hell for the nomination.
I take back everything I said about Kasich. He said if he's elected he'll get Pink Floyd back together. Clearly he knows what America needs.
@Reince @CarlyFiorina MUST be in Saturday debate. She beat Kasich Huckabee Christie Santorum & Gilmore in Iowa. She deserves to be heard.

@CounterCouncil @ThePolitiStick Agree 100%. Honestly, Carson's campaign has been on death watch for weeks, as has Jeb's and Kasich's.

@BradThor Exactly.  Kasich has never polled more than 5% Nationally, not happening.  Bush never should have jumped in, his $$$$ won't win
@dick_nixon Love fast guitars but value of Gilmore & PF is they knew how to let it breathe, to utilize empty space. Speaks well of Kasich.

Okay Christie, Carson, Fiorina, Kasich & Gilmore (and Bush too for that fact) if Rand goes down you all go down, time to drop out.
The problem with Kasich and Christie polling so high in NH is that they wont quit, at least not yet. So Marco has to find support elsewhere.

kasich has been mathematically eliminated by the votes of the people. He needs to leave. He is the establishment . pic.twitter.com/smxj7ShIMD
@greta @JohnKasich @FoxNews Is Gov Kasich being paid to stay in race?Why is media treating him like he is a viable candidate?
We agreed on Rubio, Then I shared how we voted Cruz here in AZ and gave some reasons to not vote Kasich in WI, then zipped it.

I just like that John Kasich describes himself as "hardscrabble" in his commercial. #WisconsinPrimary
Another reason to hate Kasich.  Teddy Roosevelt.  #Greta
All I can say is fox got 11 commerical after every question on greta Kasich 7 Trump is worth more to fox
@FoxNews @JohnKasich Would seriously consider suicide before voting for Kasich!
kasich is a mess
Kasich really seems to have disdain for GOP conservatives, doesn't he? #greta

@greta I must be missing something. Kasich is talking like he is in the lead. He is not. The people have not voted for him.
@realDonaldTrump @PrimMrs @GOP is paying Kasich like they did in NY w/DeDe Scozafava! She dropped out 2 days b4 election~Just enough 4 Owens
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/Eax5m05v5IE?a  Trump says it is 'unfair' of Kasich to stay in race

@greta @JohnKasich @FoxNews Kasich again teaching what serious ,honest campaign is all about.
#kasich is the safest bet #America
Kasich deplores Congressmen who are unwavering in policy, then praises persistence. Inconsistent much, Johnny? @greta #KasichTownHall
@greta @JohnKasich @FoxNews Kasich is a complete idiot. If anyone really liked him they would have voted for him. Only won Ohio. Such a jerk

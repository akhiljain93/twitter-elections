After April 26th, the meme that will pervade the Republican race is that "Cruz and Kasich are just helping Clinton."  Wait for it.
4/5 states on Tuesday, Cruz is polling in teens behind Kasich, lol  Cruz NEW slogan @SenatorRonbo @cerebraldebrispic.twitter.com/VN5jBTcvbT
I'm getting the sense that voters are just pretty much done with Cruz and Kasich and after the 26th will start demanding they get out.
Funny how Cruz has stopped calling for #Kasich to drop out, now that #Cruz desperately needs Kasich to stay in. Its over Ted. Bye.

This all comes down to Indiana. I don't see another way around it. This is a test of Kasich and whether or not he is #NeverTrump Step aside.
Trump has said he likes sanders he likes Rubio and kasich meaning he likes everyone but wouldn't vote for them

@Ricky_Vaughn99  The term for what Cruz and Kasich both have, that manic, delusional overestimation of self-importance, is Stump Sickness.
I'd love to see a 2016 campaign prison. Trump can build it. Bernie can tax it. Kasich can whine about it. Hillary can live in it. #Cruz2016
Heck the betting markets have Kasich and Sanders quite close right now https://electionbettingodds.com/ 
At this pt, I think there's a fair argument to be made that Kasich has a stronger path to the nomination than Sanders. (1/?)

Bush talks trash about Kasich on Obamacare. Easy for him since he's been out of office forever and never had to take a stand.
Not quite sure how Kasich could/should do that but it's something for them to consider - more pressing concern, obviously, is NH itself
Our Candidate board in English class. @benshapiro Kasich description is the best pic.twitter.com/HxjMsmP21Y
If Kasich does well in NH his next move is to find a way to pivot back right - would probably be best use of his post-primary news coverage
If Kasich can play the above-it role without SAYING he's playing the above-it role, it may swing well for him. But if he says it, he loses.

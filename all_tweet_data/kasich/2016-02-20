Cruz, Rubio, Kasich all been trending up in recent SC polls. That momentum may let them outperform poll avg today. Don't be surprised if so.

If current exit poll #s hold (who knows), would put enormous pressure on Jeb/Kasich/Carson to drop, which could give big opening for Rubio.

@allahpundit @hotairblog Trump won't break 30, Cruz won't beat Rubio, Bush won't beat Kasich.
Seems like I've heard this before... #election2016 #kasich #obamahttps://vine.co/v/irW0mZEJA3p 
"@robbysoave: We all know how this primary is going to go. Only real question is whether Kasich beats Bush for fourth" john vs john.
Kasich just said "WOO-ster."
Updated best guess for SC, based largely on select polls:  Trump 30 Cruz 24 Rubio 22 Bush 10 Kasich 9 Carson 5  2/2
Prediction time: Trump 32, Cruz 22, Rubio 19, Bush 12, Kasich 9, Carson 6 http://bit.ly/1PNZb6Y  @hotairblog

It's bizarre to think that tomorrow we are likely to wake to the news that Trump won SC and Bush and Kasich have dropped out of the race.
Kasich asks girl her sea lion toy's name. It's Fluffers. Kasich: “I cant think of a better name for a sea lion than Fluffers. Maybe Bernie.”
RUBIO BUSH KASICH CRUZ all have taken TONS of MONEY FROM DONORS ALL OWNED Trump is SELF FUNDING and in this race TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
@exjon Why give Kasich so much support?
Even a last-place finish today would fit into John Kasich's overall plan, his campaign... http://fb.me/ujWBjosu

@dminor85 @HawkinsUSA Kasich may not drop out, but Jeb is the big drag on Rubio.
Trump fans excited over first poll showing him beat Hillary Head-to-Head. Totally miss the part in poll showing Kasich Crushing her.

Disabled vet speaks of 5 yr old claim unfulfilled. Kasich puts him in touch w Sen Tarr, speaks of need 4 them not to have to stand in line..
@KenGardner11 @HawkinsUSA Kasich isn’t dropping out. But if Jeb and Carson would drop out, Rubio  will definitely benefit.
Some of the complaints about Rubio fans are justified. However, worst sect is the group opposing Kasich. Seldom on policy. Disgusting
Jay Allan Retweeted slone
@HawkinsUSA Yes. The best possible result from tonight is that Jeb finally calls it quits and maybe Kasich, too.

Haven't spoken with any Kasich supporters so far. Kasich picked up endorsements this week from both @postandcourier and @thestate #SCPrimary
@AviWoolf He despises GOP base. If ppl have the mistaken idea that Kasich would consider the will of the ppl, they gotta another think comin

@NakYoSocksOff it'd be so bad if it came down to Trump vs Clinton. I think if it was Rubio or Kasich vs Clinton it'd be an easier choice.
Kasich is someone that I would definitely consider
"I think you’re just a lovely man," woman tells John Kasich, but says she wants strong leader to face Putin, worried he's "too nice."
Kasich's comment that he would bring FBI and Apple together behind closed doors and they'd figure it out is also kind of Trump-esque
Bush and Carson should just drop out and endorse Kasich at this point, tbh
Questioner suggests Kasich is "a lovely man," perhaps too nice to handle other country leaders. Candidate disavows, vows to destroy Isis...

After hearing John Kasich would offer him a cabinet position, Chris Christie says he would rather have a spot in the pantry. @absrdNEWS
A Trump-esque Kasich comment: "I was the first one that said we need to destroy ISIS. Now everybody's saying it."

My optimistic but realistic prediction for SC: Rubio wins, followed by Trump, Cruz, Bush, Kasich, then Carson.
MA voter to Kasich: I think you're a lovely man but with Putin and some of your rivals, "I worry that you're just so nice."
@UFGoonerAJ @The_usmnt25 @FGrimesN7 @Dukester_94 Something may happen with Kasich but he never got the media support because he isn't part

Hillary only beats Donald Trump by 1 percentage points in a GE. she loses to Kasich, Bush, Rubio, Cruz. BUT she's the "electable" one.

Trend at two high turnout downtown precincts: voters wanted to choose Jeb or Kasich but went Rubio bc others didn't have a chance #scvotes
I can't help but feel Kasich's compassionate common sense approach strikes a cord considering the rest of the bickering in the GOP. Breakout

@_RobertHoover @subedew @NumbersMuncher - Kasich, Carson and Bush need to withdraw. For the better of the party.
Kasich hitting all his basics at 1st MA town hall: Dad was a mailman, I met Nixon, positive campaign, we're all special, balanced budget etc
@robertwrighter I agree, but if Kasich stays in for Michigan, Ohio etc it could help Trump

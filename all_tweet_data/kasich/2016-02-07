Geting anti-Kasich messages from PACs today. Kasich is on the verge of breaking through, and Jeb's and Rubio's people know it.
John Kasich jokes about Democratic primary run in New Hampshire http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-kasich-jokes-about-democratic-primary-run-in-new-hampshire …
what about kasich? can i introduce kasich?
The Rolling Stones play now as Kasich is 20 minutes late. The man next to me doesn't seem to mind, as he is singing along.
Anyone notice Kasich grinding his teeth uncontrolably when Christie started addressing him? He looked like he was going in panic mode
@writingdownpat Your take on ABC GOP Debate. I saw it as biased and more the Kasich, Bush, Christie show. Trump, Rubio, Cruz 5 stars
@realjennya Whats even more telling,does anyone even discuss Christie or Kasich? IMO they're just taking up space that Carly could have had
Kasich playlist recycling, it seems. Surely that means he'll start soon? #BORinNH
The big game is fast approaching, and I placed my bets days ago.  My underdog pick for #2 spot in NH, Kasich, seems to be panning out.
Packed high school cafeteria for Kasich in Concord, people still coming in, no Kasich yet. #aunh2016 #FITN
Here are the current RCP ranges for NH: Trump 29-36% Rubio 12-19% Kasich 9-17% Cruz 9-16% Jeb 7-13% Christie 4-6% Fiorina 2-8%
I think it's unlikely all three of the governors stay in the race after New Hampshire.  Jeb! and Kasich will get by, @ChrisChristie wil drop

Voters at event for Ohio Gov. John Kasich tell me they are shopping around, haven't fully committed to a candidate yet. @BostonGlobe
@buggazing Now THAT'S life in the "Kasich lane"!
"What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich?"  I'm still laughing at the awkwardness of the intro at last night's #GOPDebate 
Kasich majorly fluffed foreign policy questions in the last debate. So far seems to be doing OK. Unspectacular, but still OK.
Cruz, Christie, Fiorina, Bush, Kasich  are done. It's Rubio vs Trump snd Sanders vs Hillary.

@NHForRand @WIRED the logic behind this: KASICH THREW A SNOWBALL HE IS COOOL!!!
Gov. Kasich is wrong about the welfare state. The Bible supports private charity and hard work, not gov't handouts!!!!!!!!!

@keiranpedley Kasich Bush and Christie interesting in NH. Have clearly gone all in. Will race end up a 4 horse race? Trump, Rubio, Cruz, ?
Chris Christie is still Chris Christie, and John Kasich still doesn't seem to realize he's running in a Republican primary...
@Michale_Doyle < you point? an article written by a kasich stooge? @Patriotic_Me @EagleEyeFlyer @DLoesch @KatiePavlich @megynkelly
@Elizabeth_Calo Hey, am I the only one who thinks Kasich has a shot at either 1st or a strong 2nd in NH?

@charles_gaba @mfcannon Not ironic...That was a FEATURE, not a bug, of the Kasich plan.  Which is fine...but be honest about it.

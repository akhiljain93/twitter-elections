Hm. John Kasich is going to need a new job soon and really likes sandwiches. And Subway needs a new pitchman.
Why Kasich made a sandwich his running mate:  -Voters like sandwiches -Opponents have no oppo file on sandwich -Sandwich won't "go rogue"
The Kasich alliance and Fiorina pick confirmed my concern that Cruz is weak. When things got tough he panicked and acted hastily. Not good.
John Kasich is currently sitting in 4th place in a 3 person race. That sums up his deliberate destruction of the GOP race perfectly.

Has Kasich picked his VP yet? Because it's "losers pick your VP day?"

John Kasich To Announce His Entire Cabinet
Not to be outdone by #CruzFiorina announcement, Gov. Kasich will also be announcing his VP pick shortly - a warm bowl of chicken noodle soup
Don't be hard on Cruz; who among us hasn't chosen Carly Fiorina as our "running mate" the day after coming in behind Kasich in 4 states.
John Kasich to announce sandwich as running mate.
Thought of this as a joke, but now thinking it would actually be successful:  John Kasich Food Network show.
What if John Kasich's whole campaign is just a stealth ploy to travel around the country and eat every state's native cuisine?

John Kasich got more sandwiches in the northeast than delegates.
If Lyin' Ted or 1 of 46 Kasich want to continue having political careers after this campaign, I advise both to drop out NOW like the others.
Lyin' Ted asked Kasich to get out of the race when he wasn't able to reach 1,237. Now that Lyin' Ted can not reach 1,237, he stays in.

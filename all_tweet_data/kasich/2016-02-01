@dick_nixon Lol, the boy thinks he can beat Kasich in Ohio!?
@EB_imconfus @DrewMTips if Cruz win Iowa, he will have beaten. Trump Rubio bush kasich Paul DNC RNC GOP fox cnn msnbc etc. etc. I'll take it
@MushKat @BoreGuru Who is John Kasich? Seriously ...
To be clear, Rubio is losing Florida by 26 points, and Kasich has 62% approval in Ohio.
Tough negative ad from pro-Kasich super-PAC on NH TV shows Jeb Bush covered in mud: 'Not presidential, Jeb,' the narrator says.
@hannah_willi there's nothing I want more than a Rubio win (well, maybe a Kasich win).
@StormForce_1 don't you love how he was discarded 2 debates ago, for Jeb, paying people to vote, and NY Times Kasich... Such nonsense.
Kasich in NH is like chugging the whole beer, than driving in BeerioKart. While everyone else is going with the staggered approach

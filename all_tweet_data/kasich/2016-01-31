Kasich asks if 12yo questioner's mom is actually her sister. "How do you think I got elected?" he jokes. "It wasn't because of my looks!"
Kasich repeatedly called 12-yr-old "sweetie" and "sweetheart." Whereas I once watched Jeb talk (in the weeds) national debt w a 7-yr-old.

Kasich "was totally amused to find out that I’ve spent $140,000 in Iowa and he’s spent $40M and they’re beating me up in Iowa. Fantastic."
I wouldn't mind if Christie or Kasich moved on from NH. Problem is that if Jeb does, R2R continues its scorched earth attack.

@MattEngland1998 fair enough. I personally like Cruz however I think Kasich and Christie can take the moderates, both gov's of blue states.

Okay, last one....Rubio may want to consider adding Kasich or Bush as VP to consolidate establishment after 3/1. Bush seems unlikely. (6/6)

@EBOlady The point is that Kasich TRIED to govern, rather than these guys that just want to shut government down.

@Lee_in_Iowa I live in Ohio. Kasich has not been vetted. He won't hold up. Worse than most RWNJs.

@chrisssaaaayyy he's very good financially, he has the same policies ideas as Trump but Kasich isn't crazy
@jennygardiner I agree. Kasich has credentials; popular Ohio gov, evangelical, acts compassionate. He could get wide support.

Kasich would win the Democratic nomination so he's out. Clinton is unelectable and Sanders will never gain support of big money dems.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism on display in this race http://nyti.ms/1nEKNoF 
@EBOlady Well, compared to the rest of the GOP field, Kasich seems downright sane.

GOP wouldn't be pushing Kasich to drop out if they weren't afraid he could win. Why not Cruz? Both have a shot at a brokered convention.

@mashable Interesting. Trump supporters never blocked anybody's rally. Failed banker Kasich & failed politician Romney are opposing Trump???
Kasich telling long winded stories about nothing! It looked alot like a Bush town hall.

I can't imagine voting for him unless he saw the pro-choice light, but I still hope Kasich kicks Drumpf and Cruz right in the teeth.

If the republicans would roll with a Cruz/Kasich ticket I would totally be behind that. But no way I ever vote for Hilary or Trump

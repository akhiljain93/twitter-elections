The Kasich "strategy" is to play delegate angles  to Cleveland. Not only is it not playing them, it doesn't even know what they are.
Kasich is another puppet for GOP.,He has lost all but Cleve. His home state but Trump was very close. The uninformed Cleve ppl voted 4 him.
@FredZeppelin12 Kasich is also for lawlessness (illegal aliens) like most of the GOP! I will never vote for him. #Trump2016
@JayCostTWS The biggest flaw to the Kasich campaign is the assumption voters will suddenly be drawn to the biggest loser.

I just saw John Kasich's bus
Kasich is pathetic. He has lost l30 states already. 1 state is all he has  so he has lost 30?elections. & he thinks he can beat Hillary Hah!
I keep getting back to this point. The Kasich strategy *in theory* could make sense. But egads. The execution!
@VictorB123 don't want him on a losing ticket!! Kasich/Rubio I would be ok with! We NEED OH&FL! Cruz from TX adds NOTHING to the ticket.

Ted Cruz is just as bad or worse than Donald Trump. If you absolutely have to vote Republican, vote Kasich. The lesser of evils.

This would be the second state in a month where the Kasich campaign has publicly misstated the delegate allocation system.

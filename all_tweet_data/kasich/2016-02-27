An open letter to my friends who are freaked out about Trump: Cruz, Carson, Kasich, Rubio. I'm embarrassed Trump... http://fb.me/4v7VP7HPr 
I'm going to predict that Rubio's attacks on Trump may end up boosting Kasich and Cruz. Not Rubio.
Rubio's descent into a low-rent version of Donald Trump means John Kasich truly is the GOP's last best hope.

@katiepack @JWGOP @JohnJHarwood 20 states vote between then lol team Kasich is delusional
No media coverage for Kasich and Carson since they aren't in a war of words with Trump.
@daveweigel what about undecideds or Kasich voters? Those are the ones he needs to break his way.
@TheStalwart Ohio and Fla are winner take all states so Rubio and Kasich will stay in.

@ThePretty_Gay John Kasich is the only one I'm actually considering right now. He's so starkly moderate compared to the rest.

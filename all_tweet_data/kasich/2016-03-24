@scottienhughes @Talk2Rusty @USARadioNetwork he stood by silent & benefited from that ad. It didn't say "support Kasich". Pass-Aggressive
John Kasich might just end up being the most despised and hated man in America for being the "spoiler" #DropOutKasich
@ellabella1792 @RanaeMayle @tonysunseri16 @JohnKasich @SenSanders Fair? Trump is winning with the voters, Kasich is not

@FoxNews @tedcruz ...Fox shows ads from Kasich and Trump during story. Free advertising
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump so basically Kasich is your guy. Good luck with that.
Kasich has yet to repudiate his backer, AL Gov. Bentley, who is mired in a hot-mess scandal. http://www.al.com  (AdvanceMedia)
"@jacey_4trump: @HPB57 @DebAlwaystrump @katerinastarin1 @ronlngbch Soros is a top donor to Kasich."!No honor amongst thieves, anymore?
In an attempt to get in front of the irony cycle which will involve voting Ted Cruz over Trump, I'm going to go ahead and support Kasich now

If everyone who liked Kasich but didn't think he could beat Trump would just vote for him, he'd beat Trump.

@John_D_Blackman I'd be fascinated to find out how big a landslide kasich would win by
GOP now running ad that breaks down delegate math and portrays Kasich as the spoiler. Wild and boring, all at once: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T95DqjUwEKo&feature=em-uploademail …
@CarmineZozzora @FoxNews Love Trump, but Ted, Rubio and Kasich give me a rash!
Said months ago, If the GOP had a brain between them they'd swallow their inflexibility and choose Kasich. But there's the problem #tytlive
"@jacey_4trump: @HPB57 @DebAlwaystrump @katerinastarin1 @ronlngbch Soros is a top donor to Kasich."!All 1 big cluster F---2 try& stop TRUMP!
@GrayConnolly @pollreport Kasich just needs 117% of remaining delegates...
Lindsey Graham: Kasich would be better president than Cruz http://dlvr.it/Kt66L7 
Isn't there some kind of rule that you have to have won more than one state to still be in the race? Kasich needs to go the hell on!
John Kasich has been the best GOP nominee this entire cycle. Him being within 4 of Sanders is monumental. #tytlive
@steph93065 @FoxNews @Varneyco - Yeah sure Fox - Kasich can't even beat Trump but can beat Hillary. It's Trump or no ONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!

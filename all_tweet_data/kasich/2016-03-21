AIPAC crowd seemed to prefer Trump's blunt honest loyalty-pledge to Kasich's story about a Jewish man weeping into his chest. Go figure.

@franklin19788 lmao, hahaha. I just can't stand the sound of his voice. I endured Kasich, but he's just boring.

I just watched Trump, AIPAC, very impressed by all except Hillary. TO BE HONEST, after Kasich, i didn't think Trump could top it. BUT HE DID
All of this sucking up by Kasich, Trump, and Cruz feels downright pornographic. #AIPAC2016 AIPAC Paul Ryan Castro

Cruz supports Israel but for wrong reasons, Drumpf doesnt believe anything he says and that leaves Kasich who does.

DID ANY 1 NOTICE HOW PREISIDENTAL FROM THE HEART TRUMPS  SPEECH AT APAC WAS AN HOW THE 20 OR 30 PAGE SPEECH THAT KASICH TOOK FOREVER TO READ

Biden, Ryan, Clinton, Trump, Kasich all rock roaring #AIPAC speeches w overwhelming response. Cruz speech quietest & most underwhelming :(
With more substance than rhetoric, Kasich gave a much better speech in support of Israel than Trump. He didn't have to say "believe me".
#AIPAC2016. John Kasich hit it out of the park!!!

Governor Kasich @JohnKasich gave a Outstanding Speach to #AIPAC today. However The @realDonaldTrump made a Full of himself again.
Kasich beats Hillary. Stop pretending that Trump or Cruz can. They both have serious electability problems.
For those that watched John Kasich & Donald Trump speak at #AIPAC2016..who's speech did you like the most? #Politics
Could def see Kasich as Cruz spoiler/Trump VP. He & Trump are very different, balance each other out. Also rarely bad mouthed each other
@DonaldGR8 I clearly watched KASICH looking down at his notes. Saw none of that w TRUMP.
Kasich is just a mistake whose time has come.

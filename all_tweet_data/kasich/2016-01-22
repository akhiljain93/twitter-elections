Kasich: Washington's Not Putting The Country First
I guess every time @OhioPoliticsNow covers Kasich's unilateral Obamacare expansion someone has to remind them he *vetoed* a legislative ban?
Kasich:   Pro: good on economy and debt  Con: supported O-care in Ohio, VERY establishment, I hear dad was a mailman one more time I go nuts
Kasich didn't "bypass some conservatives" to expand Obamacare, he vetoed an explicit ban on expansion passed by the Ohio General Assembly.
Sasha Stone: "I don't even mind Kasich actually."  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Perfect.
This is at least the 2nd time @DispatchAlerts has tried to memory-hole Kasich's OCare expansion veto, @JackTorry1..pic.twitter.com/jeRj4G8EKU

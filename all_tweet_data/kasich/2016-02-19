@byu_mac kasich seems like he is planning on staying for awhile Jeb looks like he wants to drop out already and save himself the humiliation
@Marty2634 SC will be super close, as Kasich could play spoiler. Cruz is the candidate that won't go away, but it is winnable for Trump.

Jeb and Carson have no votes to give Rubio. Kasich will not get out. The biggest Rubio surge in any state has been less than 10 points.

It looks to me like the like Rubio surge in SC is mostly scooping up undecideds and soft Kasich support that he got since NH.

GOP brokered convention= good guy John Kasich being handed the nomination like when Carl gets the company in Billy Madison.
#TheFive "Moderators"?  It will be another show & GOPe hit job. They'll prop up Kasich&Rubio while trashing Cruz & Trump. Bank on it
@NashVegas69 haha I really do like Kasich. He would make an outstanding president. Plus, Kasich v. Clinton would be a great matchup.
Useful delegate math by @mmurraypolitics. Trump is way ahead even if Rubio/Kasich win FL/OH. http://nbcnews.to/1QPb4XA 
Problem with Cruz idea of pushing out Rubio, whether before or after 3/15, is that it doesn't account for Kasich seizing the vacuum.
I'm watching the undercard #GOPDebate right now. Wait... No. It was just a Kasich ad.
@DRNashAuthor @JohnKasich Ditto. Republicans party reps were all at Rubio's. It stunk. None at Kasich.  Kasich was great, Rubio not at all.

@twitsanon @Jhotvedt2 kasich actually scares me the least, but still a republicants zombie

Why does Romney think Cruz, Rubio & Kasich would go through this process only to have Ryan or Romney take it at convention?

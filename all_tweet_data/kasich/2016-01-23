Just stop it with this Kasich surge talk.
@ForwardFalcon @chrislhayes @maddow Another story about Gov. Kasich & his plan to privatize public schools in Ohio for his charter buddies!
@johncardillo @NRO both Kasich and Rubio are far more conservative than Trump

@SimonTemplarPV I was mocking the effeteniks at National Review. I haven't decided yet. bush, kasich, & paul are absolute nos.
Santorum tells New Hampshire Republicans that he and Ohio Gov. John Kasich pushed bill to enable Health Savings Accounts. #FITN
@darreldrowland Single most important piece on Kasich. His deficit plan is a steaming crock. http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/12/kasichs-plan-to-balance-budget-does-not-exist.html …
@jbouie mind-blowing and not impossible scenario: Kasich (or establishment GOP), Sanders, Bloomberg, Trump
Can John Kasich excel in the year of the angry candidate? http://wpo.st/21q51 
@realDonaldTrump Have you seen the anti-Jeb ad by Kasich, Jeb covered in mud!
John Kasich & other republicans love toll roads because they are wealthy & can never imagine a time when they couldn't afford the tolls @CNN
Had @NRO not pushed #amnesty, same sex marriage, and Kasich I might find their opinion more relevant and less desperate.

@AJDelgado13 I don't think it would be Walker, but I can see Rubio or Kasich as #Trump's VP pick, particularly Kasich.
@FoxNews @JohnKasich @seanhannity - those polls mean NOTHING - what's Kasich's name recognition? 30% if that? Gov. Anybody outpolls HRC
Cruz better choice than Kasich for president.. Related Articles: http://bit.ly/23nrjY4 
I personally think #Kasich should be fired for allowing Ohioans to drink poisonous water.  You know, the lead and all.  #NeverKasich
Going from Kasich's event to Trump's event is like going from Rose's deck of the Titanic down to Jack's. Different kind of party here.
Trump would consider Walker, Rubio, Kasich as VP: “He made a mistake,” Donald Trump said of Marco Rubio. http://politi.co/23pUaLq 
Kasich has a moral obligation to get out of the race

I do like Kasich out of the bunch that's left. He does have a Principal Belding vibe which may or may not be a bad thing.

@AlexisinNH I guess I am okay with any of them. Walker &Kasich would help in the G/E. Rubio would counter a probable Hispanic Dem VP choice.
bernie, trump, and kasich are all in my city today
Why is John Kasich still running for president? Can someone please explain that to me?
@AlexisinNH @AJDelgado13 Kasich gives comfort to a lot of less ideological voters from both sides. Could help Trump for sure.

@AlexisinNH but Trump and Kasich have barely criticized each other, which I always found interesting.

you all hate john kasich but there's "Now Hiring" signs all over ohio since he took office and budget is balanced #gladhesstillthegovernor
No matter the outcome in Nevada ... Carson and Kasich need to drop out, and Cruz and Rubio should flip a coin to see who stays. #dumptrump

Kasich's "women came out of the kitchen" comment was referring to his 1978 OH senate campaign. When many women were in fact in the kitchen.

Thank you to Gov. John Kasich for defunding Planned Parenthood in Ohio. Abortion providers should never receive taxpayer money.
@cvpayne @stephenfhayes Kasich's "kitchen" comment should be enough for him to bow out immediately, he'll be explaining that 1 forever...
New Quinnipiac poll shows Trump beating both Rubio & Kasich in their home states. If that happens, they both are toast.
@queengost @gatewaypundit Kasich been disowned! Don't talk about women and kitchens!
@TheFive Why is Kasich getting crap for non-PC when Trump is adored 4 it? Non issue chic in crowd uptight & prob can't cook #thefive
Cause that'd be my advice to Rubio. Tell Kasich AND Cruz that he's decided to select them as VP. Then at convention go psych! and pick Haley
Republican women wasn't offended by Kasich remark. They know their place & love to be told what to do & say by their man. #TheFive
Enough with Kasich's kitchen comment!! He was talking about an election in 1978. Roles were more defined and more women were home #THEFIVE
Tell us Kasich doesn't look like Gary Shandling.
#thefive:  Kasich needs to drop out.
@laura_lrnzo Trump says far more offensive things daily yet the media is still going after Kasich for the kitchen comment.
Got a good feeling Carson and Kasich may be dropping out after the #Nevadacaucus here. I just don't see those two going any farther.#TheFive
The fact that John Kasich said women leave there kitchens to go campaign for him...what?
@BlueBoxDave @NoahCRothman yes we have to get Kasich out to stop Trump
Meh, this Kasich 'Kitchen' thing is nothing. Just like him. #TheFive

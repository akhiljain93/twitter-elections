Cruz has no chance of winning the GOP primary. Gonna be Trump or Rubio and the sooner Kasich drops out the better chance it's the latter.

At this point Kasich and Carson are, by continuing in the primary, actively aiding the Democrats: Clinton, Sanders, and Trump.
Why doesn't John Kasich do his patriotic duty and GTF out of the race? Has he ALWAYS been such a dick?

@TruthLove352 @EliRubenstein @JohnKasich Why was Cruz in Ohio or Florida? Cruz camp has refused to work with Kasich camp on this.
@rose10052 That is why Kasich polls way higher in the GE polls.
@alabamacirclew1 @TeamTrumpNC the Pledge doesn't mean anything to cruz,kasich,rubio etc etc. wrthless piece of paper
If Kasich could heat Hillary, that wouldn't matter; because their policies are the exact same.

The George Soros-funded John Kasich said he's open to having a Democrat as a running mate... http://fb.me/89Ur4LLia 
@MMFlint but, playing devil's advocate. Cruz and Kasich aren't going to be the @GOP nominee...so, moot point.
Rubio still has more delegates than Kasich 
Rose Stafford Retweeted Awesome Rants
Cruz/Kasich reaching out to delegates in the hopes of undermining Trump's big early victories Hillary is enjoying this GOP selfdestructing
@JamesRitch1 here it is, pure hatred if you support Cruz, or you support Trump, or Kasich, etc. It's mind blowing to me James.
Andrew Heagle Retweeted Donald J. Trump
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Do the poll without Kasich and Cruz! Stop this BS polling.
@syoka68 @WayneRoot This may be a 2 man race but it could be Kasich not Cruz against Trump. He has better chance on east coast than Cruz.
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/us/politics/john-kasich-campaign.html?_r=0 … This is why I don't like Kasich, having known someone who's dealt with him in the past.
Polls: Among ALL voters, Bernie beats all 3 Repubs. Hillary ties w/ Cruz, loses to Kasich. Because Bernie gets 60-70% of independent voters.

Both Clinton and Kasich have more to gain from smearing Ted than Trump... He is playing into their game to take him out of the race.
@realDonaldTrump  Distraction:  since Kasich only  has won 1 state primary, mathematics is that he wll beat Hillary in general electon
Small Business USA Retweeted Say No to the TPP
Step-father, diehard conservative, acknowledges Kasich is the only reasonable GOP nominee. Then says he's voting for Trump anyways. #upstate
@snickersbuddy @Tlore50 Kasich is the turd in everyone's punch bowl. I can't take him. I supported him as gov., until common core.
@greta Also remember Kasich and Cruz blamed Trump for the Chicago protesters instread of defending his right of free speech.

Call @ABC News: (212) 456-7777 to have @CarlyFiorina appear in #GOPDebate tonight!! She polls ahead of #Christie and #Kasich
I don't want @carlyfiorina included do to gender. I want her included cause she got more votes than Kasich and Christie. Plus, conservative.

Note to GOP: Rubio=Bush=Christie=Kasich=Clinton. There's little difference that matters between them & I won't vote for any of them.
@CarlyFiorina beating Kasich and Christie in Iowa but not being in the debate is unfair & outrageous @abcnews @ABCNetwork #LetCarlyDebate

No real signs of a Kasich surge in NH (unless you're cherry-picking polls). He's been at 12% for a long time. http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-republican/ …
Do Kasich/Bush/Christie stay in if they finish outside the top three but break 10 percent of the vote?
@JoeNBC so is the media going to start yelling out "THE GREAT SURGE BY KASICH" now?

Why are Kasich and Christie allowed to debate but @CarlyFiorina can't? Makes no sense from biased ABC. #LetCarlyDebate
@JeffClarke19 @GopDebate @CarlyFiorina She has at least as much chance as Carson, Christie & Kasich.
@jaycamikenGL @Russbarr I hope she refuses to release transcripts. It's no one's business. They aren't asking Bush, Kasich, etc. Screw them.
@chrislhayes Kasich will win
@chrislhayes Watching how close Kasich gets & I don't put it past Hillary to still pull out a squeaker. Limitations catching up with Bernie.

@JoeNBC I'm most interested in how Kasich is pulling in 17%. Literally who wants Kasich?
Latest ARI Tracking NH GOP:  Trump   34% Kasich   17% Rubio     16% Cruz        9% Bush       8%  The two NH tracking polls fairly close.
My preference ranking of remaining GOP candidates: 1) Rubio 2) Kasich 3) Gilmore 4) Carly 5) Christie 6) Jeb 7) Carson 8) Cruz 9) Trump
Some candidates are slamming Rubio for his lack of accomplishments in the senate. Accomplishments are important and Gov Kasich has the most.

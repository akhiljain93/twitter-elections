Kasich can you really in good conscience say Cruz would be better he cheated on his wife, lied in Iowa not a very Godlike person HELP TRUMP
Still can't believe that there are people from my generation that support Trump, if you're a republican with any sense you'd want Kasich.
Like Kasich, I really feel like a 19th-Century millennial in an older man's body.

JUST Say "NO!" to #UndocumentedDemocrats --> TRUMP - Christie - Huckabee - Rubio - Kasich - Ryan - Romney - McCain #PJNET #CCOT
Kasich getting classified as a moderate is about as ridiculous as Trump getting classified as a conservative
There is no prez trump/Cruz. We can be party of mid class w/o being party of rednecks, climate deniers, and young earth creationists.Kasich!

@ProudAmrcnSon Cruz is a stooge. GOP using him for contested conv so they can put their own puppet in place. Namely kasich why else he in???
@AnnCoulter Cruz campaign tactics less than honorable. At least Kasich doesn't scuttle around trying to poach delegates!@johnkasich
Kasich is scary. Kicks puppies and keeps forcing himself after we have all said NO! No means no, John!
Economic fallout grows from NC "bathroom law" http://abcn.ws/1qItu7n  John Kasich not supportive.
Do you expect Cruz or Trump to nominate Rubio or Kasich as VP running mate ?
Kasich makes case for convention nomination during Maryland swing by David M. Drucker      http://washex.am/23vJRWo  via @DCExaminer
Can you imagine a more boring race? Kasich is a bathroom break at debates.  @stingr67 @Stellasasha1 @clantro
I'm surprised Trump hasn't tried to get teeny bopper votes by calling his rival "Basic Kasich" yet. #NeverTrump
@renomarky @mkues65 -- Kasich will use the delegates to negotiate being Trump's VP
@FrankLuntz The only reason Kasich does well in the polls is because no one knows who he is. Once I found out, I can't stand him.

Cruz can pretend he wants Kasich out. But Trump would have won Ohio & already put this thing away. And Northeast would be even bigger Trump!
@FrankLuntz @MorningConsult @Libertar_Latino LMAO  Kasich can't even win a state outside his own. I won't vote for him. This is a JOKE!

If election were today, Trump & Cruz would lose to Clinton but Kasich would win, per @MorningConsult analysis of 44K https://morningconsult.com/presidential-election-2016-electoral-college-projection/ …
U have to go back to the 50's to find primary rules where John Kasich would be allowed on the ballot with only one win! Why's he running?
@mkidwell05 - Kasich should have got out way back.  It's pathetic that he's still hanging on.  There should be a rule to make him leave.

Cruz and Kasich both pass the "electability" line. That Kasich *might* be 5% (made up number) more electable than Cruz is outweighed by...
@Thomas_IL_ @JackBlaine3 Given the choice between a Kasich/Rubio or Rubio/Kasich ticket I'd definitely chose Rubio as prez/don't care abt VP

Only way Kasich is getting on a ticket is as Cruz VP. Doubt Cruz delegates would allow him as Trump VP.
If Kasich drops out, Trump gets his 66 delegates under Ohio GOP rules. He will NEVER drop out for this reason alone. pic.twitter.com/uCKJXARh7A

Nobody outside of the @gop knows who the hell John Kasich is.  I don't believe any damn poll, that shows him winning in Nov.  Total BS
Next: Kasich. No path. No chance of getting to 1,237. So why is he in the race?  I’ll ask Charlie Black – a John Kasich strategist next.

Cruz is making a mistake by trying to act too much like trump. Early on He should just be answering questions intelligently. Shut up Kasich.
Kasich wants 2 be Prez? He could stand in center of a room & no one would notice. Prez has 2 be bigger than life. Nice guy. Never be Prez.

Where was John Kasich last night? Was he boycotting Prez debate just like Trump? Oh right, he was there...but invisible.
@JWGOP @dick_nixon Not mentioning Sebring was a missed opportunity for Kasich. Now, media reporting Sebring's absence in his Flint answer.
.@factcheckdotorg reviewed the numbers & Kasich's citation of recidivism rates to defend OCare is wildly dishonest http://www.factcheck.org/2016/01/factchecking-the-seventh-gop-debate/ …
I don't include John Kasich in the goob group. He's the only one not selling their soul to the Tea Party, which is why he has no chance.
@jsdtweets Ted Cruz "haz cheeseburger," Rand Paul "pizza rat," Jeb Bush "Shut up and take my money," John Kasich "Milhouse is now a meme."

#gopdebate Kasich: "I saw Reagan do it..." Well, yeah, so did I. But nobody ought to elect either of us President.
just started the 7th GOP debate. Paul is coming off strong. Kasich still nails on chalkboard.

Haha Bernie Sanders, Trump, and John Kasich are the furthest from me. I'm not considering Trump or Clinton anyway.

You can measure the success of Trump's event last night by the fact he never trended last night & today Carson, Paul, & Kasich are trending

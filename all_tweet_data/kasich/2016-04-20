@MJRustic I personally don't put my hopes behind any gop (except maybe kasich). Ryan is a non-starter issue. I hope dems win. G'night!
@Cathy4USA @Mediaite GOP obligated 2nominate a candidate who can beat Hilary.that's not trump or Cruz & Rubio has more delegates than Kasich
Trump will take at least 89 delegates #nyprimary Kasich wins his first three in a month. Cruz may get shut out of the state entirely.
@RonComerchero @TrimbleSam Rubio at least had the brains to get the hell out of the way.  Kasich is a megalomaniac.
MSM fallback embarrassment: Cruz and Kasich got more raw votes in Ohio and Texas than #Trump did in New York.  These people are psycho!
Do U Kasich supporters know Ohio has brought in thousands of Muslum migrants and 92 pct. of them are on welfare? Who are U people?
@risetoflyy @Kodie2038Donna @TheLastRefuge2 the video of kasich someone posted in the comments of the article was priceless too
@amandacarpenter Cruz called his wife "the love of my life." Would that make you like the Kasich of his love life? Or do you come in 3rd?

@Mediaite Then maybe Kasich, if he's not Trump's VP, should run for mayor of New York. 'Cause other than there & Ohio, he's gettin nothin.

@Junebug1952 @musicgirlsuzi @RussSegner @jensan1332  The people who know The Donald best, his neighbors, voted for: Kasich 45.2% Trump 41.8%
@FiveThirtyEight Cruz has been whining for Kasich to drop 'cuz "only Cruz" can beat Trump. Without Kasich, Trump would've won all 95 in NY.
I'll bet Kasich had tears in his eyes when he saw this. "If you can make it here..." pic.twitter.com/nSJcKPxMmP
@warriorwoman91 @HeimishCon (I imagine that moderates will prefer Kasich but could be convinced to go Cruz because Kasich)

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump we've got to get Trump at 50%. I admire Ben Carson but him and Kasich need to drop out.

At some point, Rubio must make positive effort to win Cruz/Kasich/Carson voters. But Trump's right on the basic point—Rubio's a lightweight.

.@Shoq Rubio, Cruz, Kasich, Trump. Not a moderate Republican in the lot. They'd reverse civil rights for LGBT, defund @PPact, & tilt SCOTUS.
Voters following the polls rather than seriously assessing the candidates is dangerous. Gov. John Kasich shines. http://johnewade.com

@FoxNews You need to cover, report and talk more with @JohnKasich! None of them have the experience or knowledge that Kasich does.
Right now I fear this more than I do Kasich

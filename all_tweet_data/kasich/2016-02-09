I think Kasich may surprise people in the primary tonight. don't think he'll win but he'll probably beat rubio or cruz.

@KStreetHipster It's a shame, I feel like Kasich is one of the guys who should be very electable but like many others he never had a chance.
GURU J: NEW HAMPSHIRE 1st Tier      2nd Tier 1.Trump   4. Rubio   2. Kasich  5. Cruz 3. Bush     6. Christie *#2-5 w/5 pts! holy cow!
if kasich does win lol its gonna kill donald trump's momentum he lost in iowa already and was supposed to win in nh
Wonder if Kasich's months spent stomping around New Hampshire instead of doing the job I'm paying taxes for him to do will pay off.

Got myself (Kasich) press credentials for first time. Little badge around my neck. So now  in closed room with 40 other people watching TV.

Kasich has been all-in on the Granite State, campaigning extensively here & boldly rewriting the map. #FITNpic.twitter.com/7WPAsUxbrk
@gardenpink @boxeocubanocom @marcorubio @ChrisChristie Ironically, he helped Bush and Kasich not himself.

@Wiseronenow @msnbc MSNBC does realize that there R % given at bottom of screen, right? 3-way tie: Trump/Cruz/Kasich all w/ 9 delegates.

Kasich has nowhere to go after NH. He polls at 2% in SC. Ohio doesn't vote until after Super Tuesday. And he won't even win NH, Trump will.

It would be so amazing if Kasich or Rubio somehow beat Trump tonight
1. Trump. 2. Kasich. Might that be it? Let's see. #NewHampshirePrimary #beforetiming
A third of New Hampshire GOP primary voters were independents, per exit polls; exact threshhold John Kasich team said they needed today.

Final prediction before the real numbers come out:  Trump 30% Kasich 18% Rubio 16% Bush 13% Cruz 12%  Christie >10
@IntlWOM Kasich is perfect candidate for NH. Rubio's strategy is collecting delegates.

@ametsfan seriously though, on the left: Bernie. On the right: Kasich.
Wholly unscientific, but talking to voters today I did pick up some late, breaking support for Kasich #NHPrimary
#Kasich & #Trump are neck & neck RT@ForecasterEnten The exit poll data I'm looking at is looking back at me & saying hello-I'm truly alarmed
Bush and Kasich just aren't going to do as well here as FOX seems to think. This will be Trump> Rubio> Cruz
In which  @NYTimeskrugman points out John Kasich is a fraud “Hard Money Men” http://nyti.ms/1QU2d9Z 
@TrumpNewsNetwrk - Kasich in 2nd? LOL!
Kasich salvaging a campaign...and possibly a country.
Exit polls they just showed on Fox News give hope to a possible Kasich 2nd place finish in #fitn. We have no idea if they'll prove accurate.
I could bring the whole English bookmaking system to its knees if Kasich wins.
Who would've thought that Kasich would be such a threat to Trump winning in New Hampshire? Wow!
I can see Kasich doing very well tonight. The ground game helped Cruz beat Trump in Iowa. Kasich has that ground game in NH. #fitn

I'm still not understanding what a 3rd or even 2nd place finish does for Kasich nation-wide other than further clog establishment lane

My prediction #GOP: @RealDonaldTrump stumbles. His voters don't turn out. He wins w 25%. Followed by #Cruz, #Rubio, #Kasich, #Christie.
Exit polling shows:  Trump Kasich Bush  The three worst candidates that are guaranteed NOT to be the nominee
@PatriciaBride Fox scewing exit Polls in favor of Rubio and Kasich.  I am so sick of this.  Please Jesus deliver us from this evil.

@HotlineJosh @VictorB123 Kasich has no chance in any conservative state. Thanks NH for dragging things out!
NH  Repubs- Fox News Exit Poll "Shares My Values": Cruz 23% Kasich 18% Bush 16% Rubio 15%
Just heard from former AL Rep. Spencer Bachus. He’s on the ground in New Hampshire campaigning for POTUS candidate John Kasich.
#NHPrimary early exits predict spin will be big for Kasich. Trump win may be smaller than expected with kasich Cruz Bush and rubio tie for 2
Worst case scenario for Democrats tonight is a big Kasich upset in the GOP race. The 1 candidate they don't want to face
@David_Gergen My gut says this is bad for Rubio and potentially good for Jeb and Kasich
Really hope Kasich does well.
#NHPrimary late-deciders break for Kasich (so far). If he beats Rubio to second it's a "BFD" pic.twitter.com/AJhNp6qbaB

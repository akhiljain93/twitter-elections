Trump winning OH counties along the southern and eastern border (Appalachia), Kasich dominating otherwise

@CalebHowe @JoePCunningham if we'd just let Kasich drag the definition of "conservative" a TINY bit further left, he'd save us all!
If Kasich doesn't win Ohio then i'll lose what little faith i have left in the people of this country
@NortheastBromo ugh whatever  I hope he suggests they go to Kasich
"Folks, now I'm a Christian, spare some change so my boy can get his TB medicine."-excerpts from Kasich speech tonight.
R.I.P Rubio and Kasich's presidential run. Sorry it's true.
I'm just going to put this out there. Want to beat Trump? Clinton/Kasich ticket will do the trick @HillaryClinton @JohnKasich
CNN numbers just shifted pretty crazy in Ohio. Now Kasich with a slight 5% lead very early
Maybe Rubio and Kasich will finally get their sorry butts out of the race and make it a 2 man race as it should be now!

Looking close between Kasich and Trump, but exit polls give the Governor a slight edge. Stay tuned.

#MarchMadness starts early with #SuperTuesday tonight. My #FinalFour prediction - Trump, Kasich, HRC, and Bernie.
Early returns in OH: Kasich doing about as well as Romney in Cincy/Cleveland burbs, but doing better so far in NW Ohio (Lima area etc).
Look at this line of people outside Kasich's watch party in Berea, Ohio. Might be the longest line... http://goo.gl/7Jto5C 
@seanmdav Just stop. Cruz and Kasich delivered 99 delegates to Trump in Florida. Kasich has won zero states, yet he keeps getting a pass.

Kasich is winning for the Republicans and Clinton for the Democrats.
So, I know the results are early but what happened to the big lead Kasich had in OH polls???

The first statewide returns have Clinton leading Sanders 69% to 30%. Kasich leads Trump 45% to 32%.

Truth: John Kasich's biggest critic is himself. Apparently, his second biggest critic is some a-hole on twitter who can't spell. #KasichCan
I live in Ohio and I will be embarrassed if Kasich wins Ohio he has no shot in the general election. #TrumpTrain
If Rubio was smart he would drop out of the race so that the votes would go to Kasich/Cruz

@FoxNews @JohnKasich Mr Kasich is  overwhelmed and underwhelming on the Belgian attack.
@FoxNews @JohnKasich. Kasich believes if we hug and kiss the enemy they will love us.  Sameas Obama

@FoxNews @JohnKasich Kasich... Columbus, your MUSLIM SANCTUARY CITY is a target too!!! Thanks to your INCOMPETENCE!!

#greta Kasich is wobbly and lukewarm on the Belgian bombing
Kasich says Muslims worldwide are condemning the Terrorist attacks.Funny, I haven't seen any of those protests on the news. Must be private.
#Greta why do you give Kasich air time - he needs to go back to Ohio
@WDFx2EU @tedcruz @glennbeck Just heard Kasich speak...Doesn't mention Trump at all. I mad up my mind...#NeverCruz !I'll never vote for him!
Has any one else seen the news today when Kasich was speaking, he is just another establishment guy, his ideas... http://fb.me/2N7UFxOKz 
"There's no question that we need to move on military action in a coalition against ISIS both in the air & on the ground" -Gov Kasich on FN
Will someone inform the Rat Kasich than Muslims are not condemning this act of violence. They need to stand up and turn in the ones who kill
@greta Kasich obviously has NO PLAN to protect Americans from murderous HATEFUL MUSLIMS. He's weak.
Donald a Trump wife Melania Trump will be #SlutUS. #FirstSlutOfTheUnitedStates. Bernie Danders, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, CNN, MSNBC, FoxNews
#Greta @Foxnews Kasich says Muslims all over the world have condemned this attack? Really? I mean, really?
Don't ask Kasich what he'd do. He is never going to be POTUS

John Kasich just infuriated me as much as Obama with his ProMuslim horse pucky! He & O need a knock in the nards!
Kasich said Muslims worldwide are condemning the Brussels attack ....WHERE? Where are all these Muslims? LIAR!
Kasich is dunking clueless.  Cruz is a follower.  @realDonaldTrump is the only leader we want or need.
@FoxNews @JohnKasich no question we need Donald Trump as president. Kasich would be good VP
Kasich says there are holes to fill and in OHIO we fill those holes with broken car parts !!!!

Kasich says we need to find the holes and then fill those holes to stop terrorists....uh yeah....so inspiring...NOT

Kasich DEMANDED BHO return to the US, instead BHO went to Argentina. We are probably better off with BHO in Argentina.

@KitaryaKyosubae @Spacekatgal @Jezebel That said, I think total employees is a better measure:  Bernie 42% Hillary 61% Trump 28% Kasich 22%
Kasich professes his existentialism while Sartre & Camus roll over in their graves, respectively, or existentially?
@apocalypsebiker @marcorubio The odds are long, but still hoping for a Kasich/Rubio ticket. In my opinion they were the 2 best candidates.

News media, Kasich, Cruz, Clinton using the blood of innocent people to promote their political views to further the Stop Trump movement
I really hate that Trump and Cruz make Kasich sound like a Democrat.
@CNN and Wolf Blitzer who just told Dumbass Kasich after his rambling>"Obama should have cut Cuba trip"short>>ISIS would have triumphed!!

Hilarious that Kasich says Obama should cut his Cuba trip short, since he's been "running" Ohio by cell phone for months.

@berniesanders @marissaaaav why no gop? Kasich would be more counter-productive in businiess & statesmanship along with Eastern aid.
John Kasich, put a muzzle on ur idiotic mouth and stop politicizing everything just to make yourself sound relevant beacuse you are not.

Kasich has no idea what he's talking about right now on CNN
Cruz and Trump are wack jobs. Kasich is taking a strong stance against them both. #ImWithHer, but at least Kasich appears human. #CNN

Kasich isn't gonna be nominated and that's a real shame.
Kasich regarding Brussels-Let me guess: Can't close borders. Can't deport. Can't fight back. Can't win. Can't offend.Must  drop confetti.
KASICH ON CNN IS A BIG PHONY.  HE HAS REFUGEES IN PAINSVILLE OH. 10 MI FROM NUCLEAR POWE PLANT.  NATO IS DOING A BIG FAT NOTHING

Kasich - Trump wrong on Muslims, we should strengthen nato.
Kasich saying we don't need to alienate the Muslims who are on our side.
John Kasich on @CNN saying when people in Europe bleed, all of us bleed. Maybe. But let's say that about Africa, too. #racialundertones
I actually like John Kasich a lot. He's the only GOP candidate with common sense.
Although Kasich walked it back later, he said he likes Garland & would consider him.  I owe Democrats & Obama nothing. #Bernie or #JillStein
You know what as far as foreign policy, homeland security and our military Kasich is the man 
Liking Kasich on CNN right now
GOP candidates trying to comment on Brussels and, predictably, it's a clown show. Trump "ban all Muslims" and Kasich "cancel Cuba"
.@realDonaldTrump with Kasich there would be more of the same in regards to terrorism. He doesnt want to offend muslims.
idk why people don't pay more attention to kasich. he is by far the most reasonable candidate
John Kasich is visibly annoyed with Wolf Blitzer asking him about Trump/Cruz's crazy Islamophobia
"An attack on western civilization" Kasich on the bombings in Europe. Is this the only time "we" care?!!

Rubio will win Florida, have a good chance at Texas, and Kasich will win Ohio if he stays in
Dumber idea: Miggy at 3B or Kasich as Dem VP nominee.

John Kasich is a fraud.  He laundered money from OhioJobs and now ECOT.  Americans deserve better.  #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
If Kasich stays in, I can't see Rubio winning more than one or two states. cucks btfo
Has Kasich completed his spirit journey yet?
Cruz needs Texas. Rubio will need Florida. Kasich needs Ohio. And Ben Carson needs - a miracle. (Via @politico)

If Kasich cucks Rubio hard in the establishment lane all the way to the convention, he'd earn a VP slot IMO.

Since Rubio's surrogates can't name any accomplishments maybe he should drop out to clear the way for Kasich.

@iptuttle In fairness, I had originally thought the title referred either to Trump, or to Kasich and Carson.
"Mr. Rubio could promise to adopt or address some of Mr. Kasich’s issues." Hard to do in an issueless race. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/upshot/john-kasich-republican-nomination.html …
That would be a negative: John Kasich says he can beat Donald Trump one on one http://nyti.ms/1QF9gqo ”
@BostonGlobe @JohnKasich Cruz &Rubio are relevant. Kasich is in single digits. He doesn't have 15%. He is a spoiler to persist.

Gettin' real: If Carson does bail after 3/1, and Kasich likely will too, we'll really begin to see if Rubio can enforce a ceiling on Trump.

@JoyAnnReid @allinwithchris People need to understand that this was not a fluke. This is the real John Kasich. His misogyny knows no bounds.
Thinking it's still 1950 Kasich raises eyebrows with 'women left their kitchens' remark http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/02/22/kasich-raises-eyebrows-women-left-their-kitchens-remark/80757098/ …
@scrowder why aren't more people voting for Kasich? I think more people would identify with Kasich simply by the law of averages.

Must thank Kasich for getting women to leave kitchens to support him; I’ve found some pretty good ingredients and utensils lying about.

At this point, I have to assume that Carson & Kasich are secretly Trump supporters. Otherwise, they would do the noble thing and drop out.

.@RBPundit Tell Kasich and "Mannatech" Carson to get the eff out, STAT.
@Montel_Williams @JohnKasich not a Kasich supporter but the faux outrage is just plain stupid
@scrowder To be fair- you can defend Kasich's record for a moderate Democrat.
@jpodhoretz Maybe Kasich wants to be Trump’s VP bc he figures he’ll be POTUS sooner than later that way-as Trump flames out in some fashion
@Montel_Williams @JohnKasich @KarenKasich NO anyone who thinks #Kasich is sexist need only look at his #DefundPP legislation #hypocrites!
@ErickMalmstrom Carson sounds like he's in a daze. Kasich at least has a decent message although most liberal on paper

#Kasich you probably should have said "modest"'or "simple" education NOT "under"educated. I think some ppl may not like that term.
The more and more I hear Kasich the more I like him.  I hope Kasich gets the GOP nomination at the contested convention

@TrueFactsStated I'm with you. If no 1237 Kasich, Rubio, Romney, Bush, any "mainstream" Rep can't make it. It's Cruz, Walker, etc.
@raulmcgee LOL! Thanks :)) Yeah, something is very off about Kasich. He's definitely not one of my favs-- very annoying guy.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich's statement on the passing of Nancy Reagan: pic.twitter.com/1EWpzAY01B
Things are working out coincidentally. IF Kasich wasn't from Ohio, he would be pushed out by the GOPe by now, but it's helpful he stays in.
Kasich supports amnesty and "compassionate" conservatism. He also doesn't want to end any federal agencies #RedNationRising #CruzCrew
@mitchellvii Unless he, Cruz, and Kasich pull delegates away from Trump keeping him from 1237, sure...the more the merrier.
Rubio should definitely dip out before FL. Risk is greater than the reward. Kasich will get OH, Cruz got TX, but FL for Rubio is a gamble.

#Trump leads #Rubio by 8 points in #Florida http://ln.is/www.tampabay.com/blo/mn8ar …  Monmouth Florida:  Trump - 38  Rubio - 30  Cruz - 17  Kasich - 10
@Taniel been saying this for weeks. Dropping out and endorsing Kasich at same time by FAR the smartest play.
I have no problem with Rubio staying in for FL & Kasich staying in for OH. I do have a problem with Cruz campaigning against them there.

Hate to break it to #thefive DENIERS panel but RINO incumbent 2 term Kasich is gonna lose OH to Trump and Cruz combo votes

@AmateurPolSc @ericwburns I don't see Kasich becoming Nom outright but if Rubio  leaves, I think he'll do better than Cruzies think

@jennanjack @6262INSTINCT @IvoryDove if Rubio dropped out. Imo, it's not good for Trumps numbers, going forward. Same with Kasich supporters

@LionsofLiberty Heh! Kasich has been torture in many ways!
@resurgent (2/2) Also if we adopted the "settled law" argument as Kasich does, we would still have Dred Scott on the books.
Kasich, simply a pawn in the establishment scheme to keep Cruz and Trump from being president. Get the hell out! #UniteWithCruz #NeverTrump

All of which assumes all of a candidate's voters then end up voting the way we want. No bleed to Kasich or Trump after first choice out.

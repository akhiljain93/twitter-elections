Huh?!?  3 N.H. PAPERS endorse John Kasich in hard copy of Sunday paper: Nashua Telegraph, Foster's Daily Democrat and Portsmouth Herald.
@darreldrowland @DispatchAlerts Kasich: slash funding, roll back environmental rules. More crises: Toledos & Flints. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/15/this-is-how-toxic-flints-water-really-is/?postshare=5141452871706227&tid=ss_fb-bottom …
From WHIO - Kasich wants to end agency he once supported
@Kasich_2016 It's not that surprising, Kasich seeks consistency in foreign policy. Pragmatism and values. And he has the experience to lead
@nowthisnews @BernieSanders Kasich is a joke but Sanders will not beat Hillary. No way.
@jmfinn @DenisonBe Kasich never said Western religious values, he talked about values. VOA is a great concept that needs leadership

I'm not saying Bernie won't be dog fighting with Hillary, but Kasich is the last guy who should be saying this shit. He's so far down.
@TeamKasichNH Several months ago my son had to choose who to intern with, he chose John Kasich because he is the best person for the job.
Love how John Kasich talks down to Bernie about not getting to be president, yet Kasich has like 1% support. Bernie is getting good numbers.
The fact that candidates like Bush, Christie, Rubio, Kasich, and Paul aren't trumpeting their 4th Qtr numbers suggests they aren't very good
Author is 28-year #GOP House & Senate (& Kasich) staffer. Yes, every GOP candidate wd run #USEconomy off a cliff http://nyti.ms/1lcZOvD 
@DenisonBe Kasich already has
Possible Trump & Cruz severely damage each other. Cruz' ground game gets him Iowa but both hurt by fight. Kasich surprises in NH, gains mo.
#Kasich: It's over if I get "smoked" in #NH. Well, I fear that it's over, governor. Makes me sad. http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/266130-kasich-ballgame-is-over-if-i-get-smoked-in-nh …

#GOPDebate Gov Kasich He's been around since 1980's Kasich is the Problem Bush is the Problem Rubio is the Problem establishment politicians
If anything that President Obama proved, it was that experience matters.  Governor John Kasich shines in that arena. http://johnewade.com 
Final thought: two major papers endorsed Kasich…over Rubio, over Christie, over Bush. That's significant imo.
John Kasich endorsed by the Nashua Telegraph http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/opinion/editorials/1075968-465/our-choice-for-the-gop-nomination.html … #nhpolitics #FITN
Huckabee > Get out! Kasich > Get out! Santorum > Get out! Bush > Get out! You will not be president, now or ever. You. Are. Done.

@darreldrowland @DispatchAlerts Laughing out loud, Kasich thinks he has a chance!

The Nashua Telegraph endorsed @JohnKasich for President. NHs Portsmouth Herald & Foster's Daily Democrat, endorsed Kasich as well. #fitn
I know it's a bit silly talking about candidates who will never be the nominee, but can we discuss John Kasich for a moment? #fitn
Governor John Kasich is 64 and I believe is the best in mind, body and spirit of all the presidential candidates. http://johnewade.com 
@LPDonovan Maybe because of the top 3, Kasich voters are more likely to move to the Rubio camp when JK folds.
Portsmouth, Fosters, Nashua all endorsing John Kasich. Hard work paying off. #fitn
@EnragedApostate @physguy2 @neo11 @realDonaldTrump @cspanwj Only good thing, if it was kasich, he wouldnt b our governor anymore!
@LPDonovan @Neoavatara Read John Weaver's TL.  He's bashing Bush for coming after Kasich.
@cspanwj @CharlieCookDC @CookPolitical had a #freudianslip "NH decides mainstream GOP lane b/n Cruz Bush Rubio & Kasich" Cruz i/o Christie?
@amandacarpenter Kasich or Trump could use Brown to bolster their conservative bonfires. But yeah, I agree...NOOOOOOOOO!
Ohio Gov. John Kasich offers big plans for presidency, but few details - sign of the times https://shar.es/1h1LEK  via @DispatchAlerts
Attn Rob Portman, Cliff Rosenberger, John Kasich: In 2016, endorsements might have less benefit https://shar.es/1h1LhN  via @DispatchAlerts
@physguy2 I'm worried about a Kasich nomination, but clearly he's not nutty enough for RWers @neo11 @realDonaldTrump @cspanwj
Listening to Allen Iverson talking about "practice" is like listening to John Kasich talking about "balancing the budget"

You wouldn't clobber Christie while leaving Kasich unscathed if these public polls matched up with what you were seeing in your internal #s.
A COMMANDER UNIT HAS SUCCESSFULLY PITTED JOHN KASICH AGAINST RUSH LIMBAUGH'S FAT ROLLS.
@mattyglesias to paraphrase the Monty Python Australian philosophers sketch re: Kasich, are you NotTrump?
Who's where Sunday (Rs):  CBS: Kasich, Rubio  ABC: Trump  NBC: Bush & Rubio  CNN: Trump  FOX: Cruz & Ryan 2/2

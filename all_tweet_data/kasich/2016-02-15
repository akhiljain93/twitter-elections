@smallkid14 Rubio can't win. No one in GOP other than Kasich can win, and he has no chance at the nomination. Enjoy Hillary, GOP earned it.
Kasich's coalition is the west + mid-west. That's about 1500 delegates, so he could lose 5-8 states, and still be fine.
@jbview  Yeah, was saying this the other day. Kasich's mini-NH bump hurting Rubio and Bush. And Trump solid for weeks and weeks now.
Looking at the numbers, though, I think Kasich is highly unrepresented on PredictIt's nomination values. His coalition is huge.

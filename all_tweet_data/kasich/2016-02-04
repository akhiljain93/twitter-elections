@KatyinIndy I called a 3 way race a long way back..if Rubio pulls through New Hampshire higher than Cristie/bush/kasich he gets the 3rd lane

I'm not a fan of @CarlyFiorina at all, but she did beat both Kasich and Christie in #IowaCaucus @ABC should allow her in debate. #dobetter

If Christie or Kasich had made a big effort in Iowa and performed "well," they could argue against Marco momentum in NH.
Lesson for Jeb/Christie/Kasich: with so many estab. candidates in the race, completely ceding Iowa to Rubio might have been a mistake.

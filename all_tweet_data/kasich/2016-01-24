@dandrezner People are seriously paying for anti-Kasich ads?
Local ads aired right before the NFC conference championship game, in order, all from SuperPACs: 1) Pro-Christie 2) Anti-Cruz 3) Anti-Kasich
Why is Jeb Bush running attack ads against Kasich? Who is John Kasich?
Did someone seriously spend money on kasich attack ads?
Love that someone is spending money on attacking Kasich as if he has a chance
in other news, I guess Cato is running ads against John Kasich, which seems like a weird strategic choice.
@rmom65 @marcorubio @AlexConant Though Rubio may also want to consider going after NH competition. Christie, Jeb, and Kasich.

Whoever decided to spend money on a John Kasich attack ad, I have one question: why?
@StudyingLiberty Kasich is shown twice...one of those slots is probably Paul's. Time to fire an intern.
